| 道常无名       |  | The Way is always nameless.
| 「朴虽小」     |  | (And even though a sapling might be small) [^1]
| 天下莫能臣也   |  | No one can make it be his subject.
| 侯王若能守之   |  | If rulers could embody this principle
| 万物将自宾     |  | The myriad things would follow on their own.
| 天地相合       |  | Heaven and Earth would be in perfect accord
| 以降甘露       |  | And rain sweet dew.
| 民莫之令而自均 |  | Without being ordered, the people naturally govern themselves.
| 始制有名       |  | And so you have the beginning of division into names.
| 名亦既有       |  | Once there is a name sort something,
| 夫亦将知止     |  | Then you should stop.
| 知止所以不殆   |  | Knowing where to stop, you can avoid trouble.
| 譬道之在天下   |  | The Way's existence in the world
| 犹川谷之与江海 |  | Is like valley streams running into the rivers and seas.
