| 民不畏威 |  | When the people do not fear your might
| 则大威至 |  | Then your might has truly become great.
| 无狎其所居 |  | Don't interfere with their household affairs.
| 无厌其所生 |  | Don't oppress their livelihood.
| 夫唯不厌<wbr/>是以<wbr/>不厌 |  | If you don't oppress them they won't feel oppressed.
| 是以圣人<wbr/>自知 |  | Thus the sage understands herself
| 不自见 |  | But does not show herself.
| 自爱 |  | Loves herself
| 不自贵 |  | But does not prize herself.
| 故去彼 |  | Therefore she lets go of that
| 取此 |  | And takes this.
