| 大成若缺<wbr/>其用不弊 |  | Great perfection seems flawed, yet functions without a hitch.
| 大盈若冲<wbr/>其用不穷 |  | Great fullness seems empty, yet functions without exhaustion.
| 大直若屈               |  | Great straightness seems crooked,
| 大巧若拙               |  | Great skill seems clumsy,
| 大辩若讷               |  | Great eloquence seems stammering.
| 躁胜寒静胜热           |  | Excitement overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat.
| 清静为天下正           |  | Clarity and stillness set everything right.
