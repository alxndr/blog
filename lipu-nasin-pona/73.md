| 勇于敢则杀             |  | If you are courageous in daring you will die.
| 勇于不敢则活           |  | If you are courageous in not-daring you will live.
| 此两者<wbr/>或利或害   |  | Among these two, one is beneficial and the other is harmful.
| 天之所恶<wbr/>孰知其故 |  | Who understands the reason why Heaven dislikes what it dislikes?
| 是以圣人<wbr/>犹难之   |  | Even the sage has difficulty in knowing this.
| 天之道<wbr/>不争而善胜 |  | The Way of Heaven is to win easily without struggle.
| 不言而善应             |  | To respond well without words,
| 不召而自来             |  | To naturally come without special invitation,
| 繟然而善谋             |  | To plan well without anxiety.
| 天网恢恢               |  | Heaven's net is vast.
| 疏而不失               |  | It is loose. Yet nothing slips through.
