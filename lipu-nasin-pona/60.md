治大国、若烹小鲜。以道莅天下、其鬼不神 非其鬼不神、其神不伤人。非其神不伤人、圣人亦不伤人。夫两不相伤。故德交归焉。

|  |  | Governing a large country is like cooking a small fish. [^4]
|  |  | When you govern people with the Way
|  |  | Unhappy ghosts [^5] will have no power. [^6]
|  |  | Not that they don't have power,
|  |  | But their power will not harm people.
|  |  | Not only does their power not harm people:
|  |  | The sage also doesn't harm people,
|  |  | Since the two do not harm each other.
|  |  | Their virtue converges. [^7]

[^4]: A small fish can be cooked without a great deal of preparation, cleaning, spicing, etc. Ruling with the Dao means ruling without interfering.
[^5]: Spirits of people who died early, in some unfortunate way, or without descendants, who mingle in the world and plague people.
[^6]: Translated elsewhere as “numinousity,” “spiritual power,” etc.
[^7]: The interpretation of this final line varies widely among translators; we decided to try to remain terse and close to the literal meaning here.
