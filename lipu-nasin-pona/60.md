| 治大国若烹小鲜 |  | Governing a large country is like cooking a small fish. [^4]
| 以道莅天下     |  | When you govern people with the Way
| 其鬼不神       |  | Unhappy ghosts[^5] will have no power[^6].
| 非其鬼不神     |  | Not that they don't have power,
| 其神不伤人     |  | But their power will not harm people.
| 非其神不伤人   |  | Not only does their power not harm people:
| 圣人亦不伤人   |  | The sage also doesn't harm people,
| 夫两不相伤     |  | Since the two do not harm each other.
| 故德交归焉     |  | Their virtue converges. [^7]

[^4]: [Muller:] "A small fish can be cooked without a great deal of preparation, cleaning, spicing, etc. Ruling with the Dao means ruling without interfering."
[^5]: [Muller:] "Spirits of people who died early, in some unfortunate way, or without descendants, who mingle in the world and plague people."
[^6]: [Muller:] "Translated elsewhere as “numinousity,” “spiritual power,” etc."
[^7]: [Muller:] "The interpretation of this final line varies widely among translators; we decided to try to remain terse and close to the literal meaning here."
