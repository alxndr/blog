| 为学日益       |  | In studying, each day something is gained.
| 为道日损       |  | In following the Way, each day something is lost.
| 损之又损       |  | Lost and again lost.
| 以至于无为     |  | Until there is nothing left to do.
| 无为而无不为   |  | Not-doing, nothing is left undone.
| 取天下常以无事 |  | You can possess the world by never manipulating it.
| 及其有事       |  | No matter how much you manipulate
| 不足以取天下   |  | You can never possess the world.
