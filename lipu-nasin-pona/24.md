| 企者不立         |  | Standing on tiptoe, you are unsteady.
| 跨者不行         |  | Straddle-legged, you cannot go.
| 自见者不明       |  | If you show yourself, you will not be seen.
| 自是者不彰       |  | If you affirm yourself, you will not shine.
| 自伐者无功       |  | If you boast, you will have no merit.
| 自矜者不长       |  | If you promote yourself, you will have no success.
| 其在道也<wbr/>曰 |  | Those who abide in the Way call these
| 馀食赘行         |  | Leftover food and wasted action
| 物或恶之         |  | And all things dislike them.
| 故有道者不处     |  | Therefore the person of the Way does not act like this.
