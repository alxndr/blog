| 绝学无忧               |  | Get rid of “learning” and there will be no anxiety.
| 唯之与阿<wbr/>相去几何 |  | How much difference is there between “yes” and “no”?
| 善之与恶<wbr/>相去若何 |  | How far removed from each other are “good” and “evil”?
| 人之所畏<wbr/>不可不畏 |  | Yet what the people are in awe of cannot be disregarded.
| 荒兮其未央哉           |  | I am scattered, never having been in a comfortable center.
| 众人熙熙<wbr/>如享太牢 |  | All the people enjoy themselves, as if they are at the festival of the great sacrifice,
| 如春登台               |  | Or climbing the Spring Platform.
| 我独怕兮其未兆         |  | I alone remain, not yet having shown myself.
| 如婴儿之未孩           |  | Like an infant who has not yet laughed.
| 累<!--儽 not in font-->累<!--儽 not in font-->兮若无所归         |  | Weary, like one despairing of no home to return to.
| 众人皆有馀             |  | All the people enjoy extra
| 而我独若遗             |  | While I have left everything behind.
| 我愚人之心也哉         |  | I am ignorant of the minds of others.
| 沌沌兮                 |  | So dull!
| 俗人昭昭<wbr/>我独若昏 |  | While average people are clear and bright, I alone am dull and dim.
| 俗人察察               |  | Average people know everything.
| 我独闷闷               |  | To me alone all seems covered.
| 澹兮                   |  | So flat!
| 其若海                 |  | Like the ocean.
| 飂兮                   |  | Blowing around!
| 若无止                 |  | It seems there is no place to rest.
| 众人皆有以             |  | Everybody has a goal in mind.
| 而我独顽似鄙           |  | I alone am as ignorant as a bumpkin.
| 我独异于人             |  | I alone differ from people.
| 而贵食母               |  | I enjoy being nourished by the mother.
