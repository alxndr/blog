| 道之为物<wbr/>唯恍唯惚 |  | The Way as a “thing” is only vague and obscure.
| 忽兮恍兮<wbr/>其中有象 |  | How obscure! How vague! In it there is form.
| 恍兮忽兮<wbr/>其中有物 |  | How vague! How obscure! In it are things.
| 窈兮冥兮<wbr/>其中有精 |  | How deep! How dark! In it there is an essence.
| 其精甚真<wbr/>其中有信 |  | The essence is so real— therein is belief.
