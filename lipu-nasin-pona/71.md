|  |  | There is nothing better than to know that you don't know.
| 知不知上<wbr/>不知知病 |  | Not knowing, yet thinking you know— This is sickness.
| 夫唯病病<wbr/>是以不病     |  | Only when you are sick of being sick Can you be cured.
| 圣人不病               |  | The sage's not being sick
| 以其病病               |  | Is because she is sick of sickness.
| 是以不病               |  | Therefore she is not sick.
