| 吾言甚易知               | toki mi la: jan ale li ken sona e ni, | My words are easy to understand
| 甚易行                   | ...li ken pali e ni.                  | And easy to practice.
| 天下莫能知               | taso jan ala li sona e ni,            | Yet nobody understands them
| 莫能行                   | ...li pali e ni.                      | [O]r practices them.
| 言有宗                   | toki li jo e tan.                     | My words have an origin;
| 事有君                   | pali li jo e _kon_.                   | My actions have a principle.
| 夫唯无知                 |                                       | It is only because of your not understanding this
| 是以不我知               |                                       | That you do not understand me.
| 知我者希                 |                                       | Since there are few who understand me
| 则我者贵                 |                                       | I am valued.
| 是以<wbr/>圣人<wbr/>被褐 |                                       | Therefore the sage wears coarse clothes.
| 怀玉                     |                                       | Yet hides a jewel in his bosom.
