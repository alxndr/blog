| 吾言甚易知 |  | My words are easy to understand
| 甚易行     |  | And easy to practice.
| 天下莫能知 |  | Yet nobody understands them
| 莫能行     |  | [O]r practices them.
| 言有宗     |  | My words have an origin;
| 事有君     |  | My actions have a principle.
| 夫唯无知   |  | It is only because of your not understanding this
| 是以不我知 |  | That you do not understand me.
| 知我者希   |  | Since there are few who understand me
| 则我者贵   |  | I am valued.
| 是以<wbr/>圣人<wbr/>被褐 |  | Therefore the sage wears coarse clothes.
| 怀玉       |  | Yet hides a jewel in his bosom.
