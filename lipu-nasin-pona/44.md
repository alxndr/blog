| 名与身孰亲     |  | Which is dearer, fame or your life?
| 身与货孰多     |  | Which is greater, your life or possessions?
| 得与亡孰病     |  | Which is more painful, gain or loss?
| 是故甚爱必大费 |  | Therefore we always pay a great price for excessive love
| 多藏必厚亡     |  | And suffer deep loss for great accumulation.
| 知足不辱       |  | Knowing what is enough, you will not be humiliated.
| 知止不殆       |  | Knowing where to stop, you will not be imperiled
| 可以长久       |  | And can be long-lasting.
