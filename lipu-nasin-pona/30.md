|:-:|-|-
| 以道佐人主者 |  | If you used the Way as a principle for ruling
| 不以兵强天下 |  | You would not dominate the people by military force.
| 其事好还     |  | What goes around comes around.
| 师之所处     |  | Where the general has camped
| 荆棘生焉     |  | Thorns and brambles grow.
| 大军之后     |  | In the wake of a great army
| 必有凶年     |  | Come years of famine.
| 善有果而已   |  | If you know what you are doing
| 不敢以取强   |  | You will do what is necessary and stop there, not daring to use force.
| 果而勿矜     |  | Accomplish but don't boast
| 果而勿伐     |  | Accomplish without show
| 果而勿骄     |  | Accomplish without arrogance
| 果而不得已   |  | Accomplish without grabbing
| 果而勿强     |  | Accomplish without forcing.
| 物壮则老     |  | When things flourish they decline.
| 是谓不道     |  | This is called non-Way
| 不道早已     |  | The non-Way is short-lived.
