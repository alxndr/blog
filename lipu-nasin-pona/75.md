| 民之饥               |  | The reason people starve
| 以其<wbr/>上食税之多 |  | Is because their rulers tax them excessively.
| 是以饥               |  | [Therefore they starve.]
| 民之难治             |  | They are difficult to govern
| 以其<wbr/>上之有为   |  | Because their rulers have their own [selfish] ends in mind.
| 是以难治             |  | [Therefore they are difficult to govern.]
| 民之轻死             |  | The reason people take death lightly
| 以其<wbr/>求生之厚   |  | Is because they want life to be rich.
| 是以轻死             |  | Therefore they take death lightly.
| 夫唯无以生为者       |  | It is only by not living for your own ends
| 是贤于贵生           |  | That you can go beyond valuing life.
