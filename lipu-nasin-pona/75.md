| 民之饥               |  | The reason people starve
| 以其<wbr/>上食税之多 |  | Is because their rulers tax them excessively.
| 是以饥               |  | [Therefore they starve.]
| 民之难治             |  | They are difficult to govern
| 以其<wbr/>上之有为   |  | Because their rulers have their own [selfish] ends in mind.
| 是以难治             |  | [Therefore they are difficult to govern.]
| 民之轻死             |  | The reason people take death lightly
| 以其<wbr/>求生之厚   |  | Is because they want life to be rich.
