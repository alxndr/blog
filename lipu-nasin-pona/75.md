民之饥、以其上食税之多。是以饥。民之难治、以其上之有为。是以难治。民之轻死、以其上求生之厚。是以轻死。夫唯无以生为者、是贤於贵生。

|  |  | The reason people starve
|  |  | Is because their rulers tax them excessively.
|  |  | They are difficult to govern
|  |  | Because their rulers have their own ends in mind.
|  |  | The reason people take death lightly
|  |  | Is because they want life to be rich.
|  |  | Therefore they take death lightly.
|  |  | It is only by not living for your own ends
|  |  | That you can go beyond valuing life.
