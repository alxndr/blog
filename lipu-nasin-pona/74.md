民不畏死、奈何以死惧之。若使民常畏死、而为奇者、吾得执而杀之、执敢。常有司杀者杀。夫代司杀者杀、是谓代大匠 斵 。夫代大匠断者、希有不伤其手矣。

|  |  | If the people don't fear death
|  |  | How will you scare them with death?
|  |  | If you make the people continuously fear death
|  |  | By seizing anybody who does something out of the ordinary
|  |  | And killing them,
|  |  | Who will dare to move?
|  |  | There is always an official executioner to handle this.
|  |  | If you play the role of the official executioner
|  |  | It is like cutting wood in the capacity of Master Carpenter.
|  |  | There are few who will not cut their hands.
