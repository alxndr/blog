| 不出户知天下 |  | Without going out the door, knowing everything,
| 不闚牖见天道 |  | Without peeking out the window shades, seeing the Way of Heaven.
| 其出弥远<wbr/>其知弥少 |  | The further you go, the less you know.
| 是以圣人 |  | Hence the sage
| 不行而知 |  | Understands without having to go through the whole process.
| 不见而名 |  | Discerns [^1] without looking.
| 不为而成 |  | Is perfected without striving.

[^1]: Miller: "The commentarial tradition reads 名 as meaning 明."
