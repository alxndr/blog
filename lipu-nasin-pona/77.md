| 天之道                 |  | The Way of Heaven
| 其犹张弓与             |  | Is like stretching a bow.
| 高者抑之               |  | The top is pulled down,
| 下者举之               |  | The bottom is pulled up.
| 有余者损之             |  | Excess string is removed
| 不足者补之             |  | Where more is needed, it is added.
| 天之道                 |  | It is the Way of Heaven
| 损有余                 |  | To remove where there is excess
| 而补不足               |  | And add where there is lack.
| 人之道则不然           |  | The way of people is different:
| 损不足                 |  | They take away where there is need
| 以奉有余               |  | And add where there is surplus.
| 孰能有余<wbr/>以奉天下 |  | Who can take his surplus and give it to the people?
| 唯有道者               |  | Only one who possesses the Way.
| 是以圣人<wbr/>为而不侍 |  | Therefore the sage acts without expectation.
| 功成而不处             |  | Does not abide in his accomplishments.
| 其不欲见贤             |  | Does not want to show his virtue.
