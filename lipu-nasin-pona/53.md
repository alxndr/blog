| 使我介然有知 |  | If I had just a little bit of wisdom
| 行于大道<wbr/>唯施是畏 |  | I should walk the Great Path and fear only straying from it.
| 大道甚夷     |  | Though the Way is quite broad
| 而民好径     |  | People love shortcuts.
| 朝甚除       |  | The court is immaculate,
| 田甚芜       |  | While the fields are overgrown with weeds,
| 仓甚虚       |  | And the granaries are empty.
| 服文彩       |  | They wear silk finery,
| 带利剑       |  | Carry sharp swords,
| 厌饮食       |  | Sate themselves on food and drink
| 财货有馀     |  | Having wealth in excess.
| 是谓盗夸     |  | They are called thieving braggarts.
| 非道也哉     |  | This is definitely not the Way.
