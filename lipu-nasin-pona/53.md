使我介然有知、行於大道、唯施是畏。大道甚夷、而民好径。朝甚除、田甚芜、仓甚虚。服文綵、带利剑、厌飫食、財货有余。是谓盗夸。非道也哉。

|  |  | If I had just a little bit of wisdom
|  |  | I should walk the Great Path and fear only straying from it.
|  |  | Though the Way is quite broad
|  |  | People love shortcuts.
|  |  | The court is immaculate,
|  |  | While the fields are overgrown with weeds,
|  |  | And the granaries are empty.
|  |  | They wear silk finery,
|  |  | Carry sharp swords,
|  |  | Sate themselves on food and drink
|  |  | Having wealth in excess.
|  |  | They are called thieving braggarts.
|  |  | This is definitely not the Way.
