| 将欲取天下而为之       |  | If you want to grab the world and run it
| 吾见其不得已           |  | I can see that you will not succeed.
| 天下神器<wbr/>不可为也 |  | The world is a spiritual vessel, which can't be controlled.
| 为者败之               |  | Manipulators mess things up.
| 执者失之               |  | Grabbers lose it.
| 故物                   |  | Therefore:
| 或行或随               |  | Sometimes you lead[,] Sometimes you follow[.]
| 或歔或吹               |  | Sometimes you are stifled[,] Sometimes you breathe easy[.]
| 或强或羸               |  | Sometimes you are strong[,] Sometimes you are weak[.]
| 或挫或隳               |  | Sometimes you destroy[,] And sometimes you are destroyed.
| 是以圣人去甚           |  | Hence, the sage shuns excess
| 去奢                   |  | Shuns grandiosity
| 去泰                   |  | Shuns arrogance.
