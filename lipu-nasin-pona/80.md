| 小国寡民<wbr/>           |  | Let there be a small country with few people,
| 使有什伯之器<wbr/>而不用 |  | Who, even having much machinery, don't use it.
| 使民重死<wbr/>而不远徙   |  | Who take death seriously and don't wander far away.
| 虽有舟舆<wbr/>无所乘之   |  | Even though they have boats and carriages, they never ride in them.
| 虽有甲兵<wbr/>无所陈之   |  | Having armor and weapons, they never go to war.
| 使民复结绳而用之         |  | Let them return to measurement by tying knots in rope.
| 甘其食<wbr/>美其服<wbr/>安其居<wbr/>乐其俗 |  | Sweeten their food, give them nice clothes, a peaceful abode and a relaxed life.
| 邻国相望<wbr/>鸡犬之声相闻 |  | Even though the next country can be seen and its dogs and chickens can be heard,
| 民至老死<wbr/>不相往来     |  | The people will grow old and die without visiting each other's land.
