小国寡民、使有什伯之器而不用。使民重死而不远徒。虽有舟舆、无所乘之、虽有甲兵、无所陈之。使人復结绳而用之、甘其食、美其服、安其居、乐其俗、邻国相 望、鷄犬之声相闻、民至老死不相往来。

|  |  | Let there be a small country with few people,
|  |  | Who, even having much machinery, don't use it.
|  |  | Who take death seriously and don't wander far away.
|  |  | Even though they have boats and carriages, they never ride in them.
|  |  | Having armor and weapons, they never go to war.
|  |  | Let them return to measurement by tying knots in rope.
|  |  | Sweeten their food, give them nice clothes, a peaceful abode and a relaxed life.
|  |  | Even though the next country can be seen and its dogs and chickens can be heard,
|  |  | The people will grow old and die without visiting each other's land.
