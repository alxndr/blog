| 其安易持               |  | That which is at rest is easy to grasp.
| 其未兆易谋             |  | That which has not yet come about is easy to plan for.
| 其脆易泮               |  | That which is fragile is easily broken.
| 其微易散               |  | That which is minute is easily scattered.
| 为之于未有             |  | Handle things before they arise.
| 治之于未乱             |  | Manage affairs before they are in a mess.
| 合抱之木<wbr/>生于毫末 |  | A thick tree grows from a tiny seed.
| 九层之台<wbr/>起于累土 |  | A tall building arises from a mound of earth.
| 千里之行<wbr/>始于足下 |  | A journey of a thousand miles starts with one step.
| 为者败之               |  | Contriving, you are defeated;
| 执者失之               |  | Grasping, you lose.
| 是以<wbr/>圣人<wbr/>无为故无败 |  | The sage doesn't contrive, so she isn't beaten.
| 无执故无失             |  | Not grasping, she doesn't lose.
| 民之从事               |  | When people are carrying out their projects
| 常于几成而败之         |  | They usually blow it at the end.
| 慎终如始               |  | If you are as careful at the end
|                        |  | As you were at the beginning,
| 则无败事               |  | You won't be disappointed.
| 是以<wbr/>圣人<wbr/>欲不欲 |  | Therefore the sage desires non-desire,
| 不贵难得之货           |  | Does not value rare goods,
| 学不学                 |  | Studies the unlearnable
| 复众人之所过           |  | So that she can correct the mistakes of average people
| 以辅万物之自然         |  | And aid all things in manifesting their true nature
| 而不敢为               |  | Without presuming to take the initiative.
