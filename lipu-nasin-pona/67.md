天下皆谓我道大似不肖。夫唯大、故似不肖。若肖、久矣、其细也夫。我有三宝、持而保之。一日慈、二日俭、三日不敢为天下先。慈、故能勇。俭、故能广。不敢 为天下先、故能成器长。今舍慈且勇、舍俭且广、舍后且先、死矣。夫慈以战则胜、以守则固 天將救之、以慈衞之。

|  |  | The reason everybody calls my Way great
|  |  | Is because there is nothing quite like it.
|  |  | It is exactly because it isgreat
|  |  | That there is nothing quite like it.
|  |  | If there were something that were consistently like it
|  |  | How could it be small?
|  |  | I have three treasures thatI hold and cherish.
|  |  | The first is compassion,
|  |  | The second is frugality,
|  |  | The third is not daring to put myself ahead of everybody.
|  |  | Having compassion, I can be brave.
|  |  | Having frugality, I can be generous.
|  |  | Not daring to put myself ahead of everybody
|  |  | I can take the time to perfect my abilities.
|  |  | Now if I am brave without compassion
|  |  | Generous without frugality, or
|  |  | Go to the fore without putting my own concerns last,
|  |  | I might as well be dead.
|  |  | If you wage war with compassion you will win.
|  |  | If you protect yourself with compassion you will be impervious.
|  |  | Heaven will take care of you,
|  |  | Protecting you with compassion.
