| 天下皆谓我道大   |  | The reason everybody calls my Way great
| 似不肖           |  | Is because there is nothing quite like it.
| 夫唯大           |  | It is exactly because it is great
| 故似不肖         |  | That there is nothing quite like it.
| 若肖久矣         |  | If there were something that were consistently like it
| 其细也夫         |  | How could it be small?
| 我有三宝<wbr/>持而保之 | mi jo, kin mi olin e ijo ni la: | I have three treasures that I hold and cherish.
| 一曰慈           | wan la, olin. | The first is compassion,
| 二曰俭           | tu la, ...    | The second is frugality,
| 三曰不敢为天下先 | mute la, ...  | The third is not daring to put myself ahead of everybody.
| 慈故能勇         | mi jo e olin la, mi ken ... | Having compassion, I can be brave.
| 俭故能广         |  | Having frugality, I can be generous.
| 不敢为天下先     |  | Not daring to put myself ahead of everybody
| 故能成器长       |  | I can take the time to perfect my abilities.
| 今舍慈且勇       |  | Now if I am brave without compassion
| 舍俭且广         |  | Generous without frugality, or
| 舍后且先         |  | Go to the fore without putting my own concerns last,
| 死矣             |  | I might as well be dead.
| 夫慈以战则胜     |  | If you wage war with compassion you will win.
| 以守则固         |  | If you protect yourself with compassion you will be impervious.
| 天将救之         |  | Heaven will take care of you,
| 以慈卫之         |  | Protecting you with compassion.
