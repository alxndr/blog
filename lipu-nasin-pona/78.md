天下莫柔弱於水。而攻坚强者莫之能胜 以其无以易之。弱之胜强、柔之胜刚、天下莫不知、莫能行。是以圣人云、受国之垢、是谓社稷主、受国不祥、是为天下王。正言若反。

|  |  | Nothing in the world is softer than water,
|  |  | Yet nothing is better at overcoming the hard and strong.
|  |  | This is because nothing can alter it.
|  |  | That the soft overcomes the hard
|  |  | And the gentle overcomes the aggressive
|  |  | Is something that everybody knows
|  |  | But none can do themselves.
|  |  | Therefore the sages say:
|  |  | The one who accepts the dirt of the state
|  |  | Becomes its master.
|  |  | The one who accepts its calamity
|  |  | Becomes king of the world.
|  |  | Truth seems contradictory.
