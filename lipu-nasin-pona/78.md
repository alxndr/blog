| 天下莫柔弱于水     |  | Nothing in the world is softer than water,
| 而攻坚强者莫之能胜 |  | Yet nothing is better at overcoming the hard and strong.
| 其无以易之         |  | This is because nothing can alter it.
| 弱之胜强           |  | That the soft overcomes the hard
| 柔之胜刚           |  | And the gentle overcomes the aggressive
| 天下莫不知         |  | Is something that everybody knows
| 莫能行             |  | But none can do themselves.
| 是以圣人云         |  | Therefore the sages say:
| 受国之垢           |  | The one who accepts the dirt of the state
| 是谓社稷主         |  | Becomes its master.
| 受国不祥           |  | The one who accepts its calamity
| 是谓天下王         |  | Becomes king of the world.
| 正言若反           |  | Truth seems contradictory.
