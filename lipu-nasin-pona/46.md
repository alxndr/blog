| 戎马生于郊     |  | War horses are bred outside the city.
| 祸莫大于不知足 |  | There is no greater disaster as bad as not knowing what is enough.
| 咎莫大于欲得   |  | No greater than not wanting more.
| 故知足之足<wbr/>常足矣 |  | Therefore the sufficiency that comes from knowing what is enough is an eternal sufficiency.
