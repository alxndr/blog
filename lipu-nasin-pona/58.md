| 其政闷闷     |  | When the government is laid back
| 其民淳淳     |  | The people are relaxed.
| 其政察察     |  | When the government is nitpicking
| 其民缺缺     |  | The people have anxiety.
| 祸兮福之所倚 |  | Misfortune depends upon fortune.
| 福兮祸之所伏 |  | Fortune conceals misfortune.
| 孰知其极     |  | What has a definite delimitation?
| 其无正       |  | Or abnormality?
| 正复为奇     |  | The normal reverts to strangeness.
| 善复为妖     |  | Goodness reverts to perversion.
| 人之迷<wbr/>其日固久 |  | People certainly have been confused for a long time.
| 是以圣人方而不割     |  | Therefore the sage squares things without cutting.
| 廉而不刿     |  | Edges without separating.
| 直而不肆     |  | Straightens without lining up.
| 光而不耀     |  | Shines but does not glare.
