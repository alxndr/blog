| 和大怨               |  | After settling down for great anger
| 必有馀怨             |  | There are always resentments left over.
| 安可以为善           |  | How can this be considered as good?
| 是以圣人<wbr/>执左契 |  | Therefore the sage keeps her part of the deal[^8],
| 而不责于人           |  | And doesn't badger the other party.
| 有德司契             |  | The virtuous ascertain the content of the contract itself; [^9]
| 无德司彻             |  | Those without virtue are concerned about it's being exacted. [^9]
| 天道无亲             |  | The Heavenly Way has no favorites:
| 常与善人             |  | It always raises up the Good[^10].

[^8]: Muller: "左契 literally means the “left side of the tally.” Ancient contracts in East Asia were made by writing the agreement on a wooden board that would be broken in half, and rematched when the contract had been fulfilled."
[^9]: Muller: "The interpretation of 司契 and 司徹 here varies considerably among translators. We take it as one of the plethora of expressions of the pervasive notion of wu-wei in the Daodejing, which implies doing things by focusing on the content, and what one can actual do well, rather than on expectations of a rapid conclusion. Cf. the translations by D.C. Lau, Richard Llynn, Ellen Chen, John Wu, and others."
[^10]: Muller: "Cf. Analects 4:10: The Master said: “When the noble man deals with the world he is not prejudiced for or against anything. He does what is Right.” 子曰。君子之於天下也、無適也、無莫也、義之與比。"
