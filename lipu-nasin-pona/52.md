| 天下有始<wbr/>以为天下母 |  | All things have a beginning, which we can regard as their Mother.
| 既知其母<wbr/>以复其子   |  | Knowing the mother, we can know its children.
| 既知其子<wbr/>复守其母   |  | Knowing the children, yet still cleaving to the mother
| 没其不殆                 |  | You can die without pain.
| 塞其兑                   |  | Stop up the holes
| 闭其门                   |  | Shut the doors,
| 终身不勤                 |  | You can finish your life without anxiety.
| 开其兑                   |  | Open the doors,
| 济其事                   |  | Increase your involvements,
| 终身不救                 |  | In the end you can't be helped.
| 见小曰明                 |  | Seeing the subtle is called illumination.
| 守柔曰强                 |  | Keeping flexible is called strength.
| 用其光<wbr/>复归其明     |  | Use the illumination, but return to the light.
| 无遗身殃                 |  | Don't bring harm to yourself.
| 是为习常                 |  | This is called “practicing the eternal.”
