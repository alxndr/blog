| 为无为                 |  | Do without “doing.”
| 事无事                 |  | Get involved without manipulating.
| 味无味                 |  | Taste without tasting.
| 大小                   |  | Make the great small,
| 多少                   |  | The many, few.
| 报怨以德               |  | Respond to anger with virtue.
| 图难于其易             |  | Deal with difficulties while they are still easy.
| 为大于其细             |  | Handle the great while it is still small.
| 天下难事               |  | The difficult problems in life
| 必作于易               |  | Always start off being simple.
| 天下大事<wbr/>必作于细 |  | Great affairs always start off being small.
| 是以圣人<wbr/>终不为大 |  | Therefore the sage never deals with the great
| 故能成其大             |  | And is able to actualize his greatness.
| 夫轻诺必寡信           |  | Now light words generate little belief,
| 多易必多难             |  | Much ease turns into much difficulty.
| 是以圣人<wbr/>犹难之   |  | Therefore the sage treats things as though they were difficult,
| 故终无难矣             |  | And hence, never has difficulty.
