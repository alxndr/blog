| 希言自然                 |  | To speak little is natural.
| 故飘风不终朝             |  | Therefore a gale does not blow a whole morning
| 骤雨不终日               |  | Nor does a downpour last a whole day.
| 孰为此者<wbr/>天地       |  | Who does these things? Heaven and Earth.
| 天地尚不能久             |  | If even Heaven and Earth cannot force perfect continuity
| 而况于人乎               |  | How can people expect to?
| 故从事于道者             |  | Therefore there is such a thing as aligning one's actions with the Way.
| 道者<wbr/>同于道         |  | If you accord with the Way you become one with it.
| 德者<wbr/>同于德         |  | If you accord with virtue you become one with it.
| 失者<wbr/>同于失         |  | If you accord with loss you become one with it.
| 同于道者<wbr/>道亦乐得之 |  | The Way accepts this accordance gladly.
| 同于德者<wbr/>德亦乐得之 |  | Virtue accepts this accordance gladly.
| 同于失者<wbr/>失亦乐得之 |  | Loss also accepts accordance gladly.
| 信不足<wbr/>焉有不信焉   |  | If you are untrustworthy, people will not trust you.
