| 大国者下流             |  | The great state should be like a river basin.
| 天下之交               |  | The mixing place of the world,
| 天下之牝               |  | The feminine of the world.
| 牝常以静胜牡           |  | The feminine always overcomes the masculine by softness
| 以静为下               |  | Because softness is lesser.
| 故大国以下小国         |  | Therefore if a large state serves a small state
| 则取小国               |  | It will gain the small state.
| 小国以下大国           |  | If a small state serves a large state
| 则取大国               |  | It will gain the large state.
| 故或下以取             |  | Therefore some serve in order to gain
| 或下而取               |  | And some gain despite their servitude.
| 大国不过               |  | The large state wants nothing more
| 欲兼畜人               |  | Than to unite and feed its people.
| 小国不过               |  | The small state wants nothing more
| 欲入事人               |  | Than to enter into the service of the right person.
| 夫两者<wbr/>各得其所欲 |  | Thus both get what they want.
| 大者宜为下             |  | Greatness lies in placing oneself below.
