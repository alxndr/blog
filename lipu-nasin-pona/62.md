道者万物之奥。善人之宝、不善人之所保。美言可以市、尊行可以加人。人之不善、何弃之有。故立天子、置三公、虽有拱壁以先则駟马、不如坐进此道。古之所以 贵此道者何。不曰以求得、有罪以免邪。故为天下贵。

|  |  | The Way is hidden deeply in all things.
|  |  | It is the treasure of the good
|  |  | And the refuge of the not-so-good.
|  |  | With skillful words you can be successful.
|  |  | With honorable actions you can be included.
|  |  | People may not be so good, but how can you deny them?
|  |  | Therefore, even though there are great jewels brought in by teams of horses at the coronation of the emperor and the installation of the three princes,
|  |  | This is not as good as staying where you are
|  |  | And advancing in this Way.
|  |  | Why did the ancients so value the Way?
|  |  | You can't say that it was for seeking gain
|  |  | Or to have punishments to deter crime.
|  |  | Therefore it is the most prized in the world.
