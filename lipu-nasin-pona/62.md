| 道者万物之奥           |  | The Way is hidden deeply in all things.
| 善人之宝               |  | It is the treasure of the good
| 不善人之所保           |  | And the refuge of the not-so-good.
| 美言可以市             |  | With skillful words you can be successful.
| 尊行可以加人           |  | With honorable actions you can be included.
| 人之不善<wbr/>何弃之有 |  | People may not be so good, but how can you deny them?
| 故立天子<wbr/>置三公<wbr/>虽有拱璧以先驷马 |  | Therefore, even though there are great jewels brought in by teams of horses at the coronation of the emperor and the installation of the three princes,
| 不如坐                 |  | This is not as good as staying where you are
| 进此道                 |  | And advancing in this Way.
| 古之所以贵此道者何     |  | Why did the ancients so value the Way?
| 不曰<wbr/>以求得       |  | You can't say that it was for seeking gain
| 有罪以免耶             |  | Or to have punishments to deter crime.
| 故为天下贵             |  | Therefore it is the most prized in the world.
