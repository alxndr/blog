古之善为道者、非以明民、將以愚之。民之难治、以其智多。故以智治国、国之贼。不以智治国、国之福。知此两者、亦稽式。常知稽式、是谓玄德。玄德深矣、远 矣、与物反矣。然后乃至大顺。

|  |  | The ancients who were skillful at the Way
|  |  | Did not illuminate the people
|  |  | But rather kept them simple.
|  |  | When the people are difficult to rule
|  |  | It is because of their cleverness.
|  |  | Therefore
|  |  | If you use cleverness to rule the state
|  |  | You are a robber of the state.
|  |  | If you don't use cleverness to rule the state
|  |  | You are a blessing to the state.
|  |  | If you understand these two points, you know the proper norm for governing.
|  |  | To be continuously understanding the proper norm is called Mysterious Virtue.
|  |  | How deep and far-reaching Mysterious Virtue is!
|  |  | It makes all return
|  |  | Until they reach the Great Norm.
