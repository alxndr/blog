江海所以能为百谷王者、以其善下之。故能为百谷王。是以欲上民、必以言下之、欲先民、必以身后之。是以圣人、处上而民不重、处前而民不害。是以天下乐推而 不厌。以其不争故、天下莫能与之争。

|  |  | The reason the river and sea can be regarded as
|  |  | The rulers of all the valley streams
|  |  | Is because of their being below them.
|  |  | Therefore they can be their rulers.
|  |  | So if you want to be over people
|  |  | You must speak humbly to them.
|  |  | If you want to lead them
|  |  | You must place yourself behind them.
|  |  | Thus the sage is positioned above
|  |  | And the people do not feel oppressed.
|  |  | He is in front and they feel nothing wrong.
|  |  | Therefore they like to push him front and never resent him.
|  |  | Since he does not contend
|  |  | No one can contend with him.
