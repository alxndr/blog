| 道常无为 |  | The Way is always “not-doing”
| 而无不为 |  | Yet there is nothing it doesn't do.
| 侯王若能守之 |  | If the rulers are were able to embody it
| 万物将自化 |  | Everyone will naturally be changed.
| 化而欲作 |  | Being changed, they desire to do things.
| 吾将镇<wbr/>之以<wbr/>无名之朴 |  | So I must restrain them, using the nameless “uncarved block.”
| 无名之朴 |  | Using the nameless uncarved block
| 夫亦将无欲 |  | They become desireless.
| 不欲以静 |  | Desireless, they are tranquil and
| 天下将自定 |  | All-under-Heaven is naturally settled.
