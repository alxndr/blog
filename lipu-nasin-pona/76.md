| 人之生也柔弱       | jan li kama lon la, sijelo ona li kon li suwi.                | When people are born they are gentle and soft.
| 其死也坚强         | jan li kama moli la, sijelo ona li kiwen li _palisa_.         | At death they are hard and stiff.
| 万物草木之生也柔脆 | kasi li kama suli la, ona li kon li _suwi_.                   | When plants are alive they are soft and delicate.
| 其死也枯槁         | kasi li kama moli la, ona li kama lili li kama jo ala e telo. | When they die, they wither and dry up.
| 故坚强者死之徒     |                                                               | Therefore the hard and stiff are followers of death.
| 柔弱者生之徒       |                                                               | The gentle and soft are the followers of life.
| 是以兵强则不胜     |                                                               | Thus, if you are aggressive and stiff, you won't win.
| 木强则共           |                                                               | When a tree is hard enough, it is cut. Therefore
| 强大处下           | ona kiwen e ona suli li anpa.                                 | The hard and big are lesser,
| 柔弱处上           | ona kon e ona suwi li wawa.                                   | The gentle and soft are greater.
