人之生也柔弱、其死也坚强。草木之生也柔脆、其死也枯稿。故坚强者死之徒、柔弱者生之徒。是以兵强则灭、木强则折。强大处下、柔弱处上。

|  |  | When people are born they are gentle and soft.
|  |  | At death they are hard and stiff.
|  |  | When plants are alive they are soft and delicate.
|  |  | When they die, they wither and dry up.
|  |  | Therefore the hard and stiff are followers of death.
|  |  | The gentle and soft are the followers of life.
|  |  | Thus, if you are aggressive and stiff, you won't win.
|  |  | When a tree is hard enough, it is cut. Therefore
|  |  | The hard and big are lesser,
|  |  | The gentle and soft are greater.
