| 上德不德               |  | Superior virtue is not virtuous
| 是以有德               |  | Therefore it has virtue.
| 下德不失德             |  | Inferior virtue never fails to be virtuous
| 是以无德               |  | Therefore it has no virtue.
| 上德无为               |  | Superior virtue does not “act”
| 而无以为               |  | And has no intentions.
| 下德为之               |  | Inferior virtue “acts”
| 而有以为               |  | And always has intentions.
| 上仁为之               |  | Superior humaneness “acts”
| 而无以为               |  | But has no intentions.
| 上义为之               |  | Superior justice “acts”
| 而有以为               |  | But but has intentions.
| 上礼为之<wbr/>而莫之应 |  | Superior propriety “acts” and if you don't respond
| 则攘臂<wbr/>而扔之     |  | They will roll up their sleeves and threaten you.
| 故失道<wbr/>而后德     |  | Thus, when the Way is lost there is virtue
| 失德<wbr/>而后仁       |  | When virtue is lost there is humaneness
| 失仁<wbr/>而后义       |  | When humaneness is lost there is justice
| 失义<wbr/>而后礼       |  | And when justice is lost there is propriety.
| 夫礼者<wbr/>忠信之薄   |  | Now “propriety” is the external appearance of loyalty and sincerity
| 而乱之首               |  | And the beginning of disorder.
| 前识者<wbr/>道之华     |  | Occult abilities are just flowers of the Way
| 而愚之始               |  | And the beginning of foolishness.
| 是以大丈<wbr/>夫处其厚 |  | Therefore the Great Person dwells in the substantial
| 不居其薄               |  | And not in the superficial.
| 处其实<wbr/>不居其华   |  | Rests in the fruit and not in the flower.
| 故去彼取此             | la o weka. o jo e ni. | So let go of that and grasp this.
