= intro to code reviews
:hp-tags: code review, style guide, GitHub, HoundCI

"What is a code review"... what to look for: Style, Errors, Understandability

* step 0: tell GitHub to ignore whitespace in any diff by putting ?w=1 at the end of the diff URL
** use case: https://github.com/richardleebr/breport/commit/6084d79
** and then ask GitHub to make a user option where you can enable that for yourself by default
* Style
** basic stuff... Just Decide Something
*** line too long, parens or not, how to break up multiline things
*** trailing whitespace, missing newline at end of file, mixed spaces/tabs
*** quotes standard? indentation standard? underscore-or-camelcase standard?
*** this is what hound is good for
** consistency in quotes/parens/braces, casing/underscores
** preserve alphabetic order of things
*** vim: `:sort`
* Errors / Obviously Bad Things
** passwords, API keys, rails secret token, environment variables
** hardcoded domain names
** debugging detritus
** extraneous files, missing files (Gemfile.lock, compiled stuff)
** etc etc etc
* Understandability
** NAMES! be accurate and descriptive
*** files, variables, classes, functions, methods, constants, regexes, callbacks, custom events & components (repos :trollface:)
*** the only acceptable one-letter variable is `i` and only as a counter
**** if you need to nest another counter, fine use `j`
***** if you need to nest yet another counter, stop it, why are you counting that many things with such bad names
*** arrays plural of the elements it contains
*** use Pattern names when appropriate, not always
*** name your tests
** changeset makes sense for what the ask is
*** verify by having people outside the feature or project participate in code review
** to a lesser degree, sometimes good refactorings are more apparent in review
*** repeating something once is ok, more might need to be refactored
*** is there a better (i.a., more standard/idiomatic) way of doing something? (e.g. var swap, reduce, destructuring)
* got specs? anything to change in the readme?
* super extra bonus points: by now it's too late, but your commit messages are documentation; make them descriptive & appropriate
** first line should be the tldr and fit within 80 characters
** (then a newline)
** then explain motivations behind anything non-obvious in the changeset
** point out any dependencies not reflected in changeset (e.g. 3rd party)
** why did things need to change? point out assumptions.
** don't need to describe what you did; that should be apparent from the diff
** link to appropriate ticket
* all that said: there is always something to nitpick. at some point, stop nitpicking and merge the code!

Hound: http://houndci.com

* bot that can identify the basic stuff & post GitHub comments
* uses Rubocop/JSHint/CoffeeLint/SCSSLint under the hood
* configure what it cares about w/json or yml config files
* walkthrough: auth w/GitHub, houndci.com has "Activate" buttons for repo owners (might have to logout/login)
* `.hound.yml`: turn on/off specific checkers; point to config files
* config files
** default for ruby https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/hound/master/config/style_guides/ruby.yml
** default for JS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/hound/master/config/style_guides/javascript.json
** default for SCSS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/hound/master/config/style_guides/scss.yml

Style checkers: local and CI

* find a rake task for the underlying Hound checker(s)
** point them at the same config files that hound's using
* hook the lint/style checks up to travis: `task travis: %i( lint spec )`
** might need to make your own rake task
