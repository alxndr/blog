= using `LIKE` in Ecto
:hp-tags: Ecto, LIKE operator, ILIKE operator, SQL, Elixir

https://github.com/elixir-lang/ecto[Ecto] is a database adapter for http://elixir-lang.org/[Elixir] projects. The syntax is inspired by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query[LINQ], and it's all new to me, so here's my cheat notes for how to use `LIKE` and `ILIKE` operators to find records:

The key is http://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Migration.html#fragment/1[`fragment/1`]:

  where: t.name == "1" and fragment("name(?) ilike ?", p.title, "nfl"),
  select: t.id

  IO.inspect tracks
  # tracks |> Repo.delete_all

Enum.each(playlists, fn(x) ->

  IO.inspect "count #{count} uniq #{uniq}"
