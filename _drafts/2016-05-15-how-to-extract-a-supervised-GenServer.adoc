= how to extract a supervised GenServer
:hp-tags: refactoring

So you've got an Elixir module which does something, and occasionally crashes. You'd like to not worry about it crashing, so you're looking for something to supervise it and try again if it fails.

```source:elixir
defmodule Foo do
  data
  |> Enum.filter(&something_which_sometimes_filters_out_everything/1)
  |> Enum.random # this will throw an error when everything has been filtered out
end
```
