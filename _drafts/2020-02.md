It's relatively painless to authenticate a GitHub-Pages-powered site as a Creator for the Brave browser.
Doing so lets your visitors using Brave to contribute/tip (fractions of) BAT tokens as they browse your site.

Before we begin, you'll need a working GitHub Pages site (e.g. using Jekyll).

First step is to get a custom domain name (e.g. `alxndr.blog`).
I have had good experiences with NameCheap.

Follow GitHub's instructions for serving up the GH Pages site via your domain name.

Next, sign up as for a Creator account.
Begin the process of linking it to an account with Gemini.
(I recommend avoiding Uphold for the time being due to their fees.)

Within your Creator account there will be an option for adding a channel. 
Select this and there will be an option for a website, which will offer to authenticate via DNS or a file.

I enjoy the relative simplicity of the DNS setup.
NameCheap's Advanced DNS panel lets you add the necessary TXT record.

That's pretty much it!
Wait a couple weeks and see the BAT roll in!
