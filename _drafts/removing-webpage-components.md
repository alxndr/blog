title: One Weird Trick to Easily Remove (maybe) Anything from a Webpage

If you are using [Brave Browser] or [Google Chrome] or another browser based on [Chromium], or [Mozilla Firefox], there's a quick way to remove a popup or overlay in the browser window...

Right-click somewhere on the offending popup/overlay, and select the "Inspect" option. It may take a second to respond, but the whole browser window should shrink somewhat, and show a new panel with [HTML] code and maybe [CSS] code and perhaps a [JavaScript] text interface showing some errors or warnings... **don't be afraid!**

Without clicking on Anything else yet, hit the `Delete` key on your keyboard once, and if the popup/overlay is still there, try hitting `Delete` again. If you notice a part of the component has disappeared, press `Delete` once again and see if a larger part is gone...

(What's going on here?!? This is the code inspector allowing you to remove parts of the running webpage. It is only happening for you looking at this particular view of that page in that browser, no one else on the Internet is also seeing these parts of the site disappear.)
