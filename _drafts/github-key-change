On [2023 March 24, GitHub.com changed their RSA SSH host key](https://github.blog/2023-03-23-we-updated-our-rsa-ssh-host-key/), in response to their privkey being possibly exposed.
This is an entirely appropriate response, however it's rare enough that I had to look up some stuff to determine how to adjust my workflows..

# Step 1

Since GitHub retired their old key, we need to remove our knowledge of it as well.

```shell
ssh-keygen -R github.com
```

# Step 2

Add their new pubkey... This will be appending a new line starting with "github.com ssh-rsa" to the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file.

Now when communicating with GitHub over SSH, you should see a new fingerprint.

# Step 3

However, I still can't `git push` this commit I just made, what gives?
