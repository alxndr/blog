title: framework-less CLI TDD with NPM\* OMG LOL

`*` no this does not involve npm, it just made the title look good ðŸ¤·

NodeJS v16.17 / v18 introduced a new module named [`node:test`](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html) which includes basic test scaffolding!
This makes it real easy to whip up a super-basic JS test file and iterate on it, without having to set up a framework like Mocha or Jest.

Save this to a file named with a `.mjs` extension, e.g. `test.mjs`:
```
import {strictEqual} from 'assert'
import {test} from 'node:test';

test('runs a thing', () => {
  strictEqual('foo', 'bar')
})
```

...then if you've got Node >= 16.17.0 \|\| >= 18.0.0 you'll be able to:

```shell
$ node ./test.mjs
```

```
# Subtest: runs a thing
not ok 1 - runs a thing

)
    async loadESM (node:internal/process/esm_loader:91:5)
  ...

```

(Note that with Node 16.19.1 using this module will also spit out a helpful warning: `(node:8518) ExperimentalWarning: The test runner is an experimental feature. This feature could change at any time`...)
