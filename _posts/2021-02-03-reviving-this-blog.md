This blog is still alive!
Up and running on Jekyll now.
Should figure out how to support RSS feeds...

Well 2020 was a weird year wasn't it!
Can we start trusting science now please?

In some of my spare time I rebuilt [Almost-Dead.net, a setlist-tracking site for Joe Russo's Almost Dead](http://almost-dead.net).
The back-end was to be my excuse to play with Elixir, but my unfamiliarity with it became a blocker to getting anything done.
The new version uses CSVs as its data format ðŸ˜… which I can edit using Google Sheets without too much pain.
When the page loads up in a browser, it stores the (transformed) data into the client's localStorage, which makes subsequent browsing feel lightning-fast!
