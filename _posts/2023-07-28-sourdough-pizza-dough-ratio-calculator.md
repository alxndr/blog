title: sourdough pizza dough ratio calculator
---

I've been tending to some sourdough starter ever since the Great Pandemic of 2020. I'll often make pizza dough with the "leftover" starter.

Below I've created an interactive tool to let you enter amounts of starter, water, and flour (and optionally yeast and salt too), and then receive a precise-as-you-like set of numbers describing the ratios you'd entered.

(Trial and error has landed me at 1 part starter, 4 parts room-temp water, 5 parts high-protein flour, 0.1 part salt. I built this tool in order to help me fine-tune that ratio, and determine ratios for using yeast.)
