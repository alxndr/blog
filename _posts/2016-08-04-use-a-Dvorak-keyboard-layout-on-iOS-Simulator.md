...why would anyone want to have Dvorak on a mobile device?!? Actually, I only care about it in the iOS _Simulator_, when I'm using it on a computer with a real-live hardware keyboard.

In OS X's Simulator (v9.3), launch the *Settings* app from the home screenfootnote:[which you can get to quickly by pressing `Command`+`Shift`+`h`], then navigate through all these menus: *General* > *Keyboard* > *Hardware Keyboard* > *English* > *Dvorak*.

Ta-daa!
