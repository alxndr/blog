A thought experiment: how might one use a _[toki pona]_ reference document which does not rely on the Latin alphabet or other "borrowed" orthographies?

jan Tepu has created a wonderful example, [using _sitelen pona_ and realistic imagery](https://davidar.github.io/tp/kama-sona).

I'm curious about what one might look like which only uses _[sitelen sitelen]_.


## sona lon (background)

_[sitelen sitelen]_ is one of the many [orthographies](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/Writing_systems) of _[toki pona]_.

It is a beautiful and creative writing system!
But its inherent flexibility can be challenging to navigate.

As a beginner to _toki pona_ who was impatiently wanting to use _sitelen sitelen_, I found myself needing a method of defining a glyph based on its visual appearance, with only a rough understanding of the vocabulary and each glyph's constituents. This reminded me of using Chinese dictionaries with [radical and stroke count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_characters)), and I wondered if something similar (but _pona_) were possible for _sitelen sitelen_...


## nasin (method)

> tldr: Each glyph has a unique set of components (aka "roots") associated with it; Roots are ordered; Each glyph can thereby be ordered according to its roots. With a rough understanding of the roots and ordering, **a dictionary user can quickly locate an arbitrary or unrecognized glyph within a large source list.**

* The most significant aspect of the glyph is designated the **primary root**. All glyphs have a primary root.
  * The "most significant" aspect could be the center or the largest portion of the glyph, or a unique symbol compared to the remainder of the glyph.
  * The primary root will determine the broad location of the glyph.
* Remaining aspects of the glyph may be designated **additional roots**.
  * Additional roots are not necessary (i.e. some glyphs have a primary root and no additional roots); 
  * These tend to follow a pattern of "next most significant", with allowances so that glyph sequences are unique.
  * The sequence of additional roots will determine the fine-grained location of the glyph.


## (roots)

The specific roots and order are still in flux. That said:
* The sequence starts with the five vowel glyphs, roughly from front (of the mouth) to back.
* Then all the consonants, roughly grouped by feature: dots, intersections, bumps, unusual shapes.
* Then fundamental shapes not covered by the _sitelen sitelen_ phonemes, roughly in order of simple-to-complex.
* Finally, some "meta" shapes: containers/cartouches, and punctuation/plinths.

## TODO features for an online dictionary based on this...

* use SS/SP only, no sitelen Lasina
* buttons for each root sigil... click one and it filters all glyphs with the root (ones w/it as primary first)
  * definition in SP / SS
* another input method: if you know pronunciation, 'type' it by clicking SP alphabet sigils & filter list to show glyhs with that pronunciation
