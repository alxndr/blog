A thought experiment: how might one use a _[toki pona]_ reference document which only uses _[sitelen sitelen]_?

Here's an explaration: [sin la, nasin sitelen pi lipu nimi](https://alxndr.github.io/nasin-pi-lipu-nimi/?src=alxndr.blog&campaign=blogpost-nasin)



## sona (background info)

_[sitelen sitelen]_ is one of the many [orthographies](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/Writing_systems) of _[toki pona]_.

It is a beautiful and creative writing system!
But its inherent flexibility can be challenging to navigate.

As a beginner to _toki pona_ who was fascinated by _sitelen sitelen_, I was looking for many source documents to see how different people drew the glyphs.
I then found myself wanting a method of defining a glyph based on its visual appearance, not knowing its pronunciation, and with only a rough understanding of _sitelen sitelen_ (or even the language's vocabulary).

This reminded me of studying Mandarin, and using Chinese dictionaries organized by [radical and stroke count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_characters)) — and I wondered if something similar (but also _pona_!) were possible for _sitelen sitelen_...


## nasin (method)

> There are 26 "roots" (visual components);  
> The roots are in a particular order;  
> Each glyph has a unique set roots associated with it;  
> Each glyph is sorted according to its root-order.

This allows a dictionary user to quickly locate an unrecognized glyph within an arbitrarily-sized list of otherwise "difficult-to-order" glyphs, with only a rough understanding of the roots and ordering necessary, and **without depending on any knowledge of pronunciation** (of either the glyph or the patterns/motifs common to _sitelen sitelen_ glyhs).

* The most significant aspect of the glyph is designated the **primary root**. All glyphs have a primary root.
  * The "most significant" aspect could be the center or the largest portion of the glyph, or a unique symbol compared to the remainder of the glyph.
  * The primary root will determine the broad location of the glyph.
* Remaining aspects of the glyph may be designated **additional roots**.
  * Additional roots are not necessary (i.e. some glyphs have a primary root and no additional roots); 
  * These tend to follow a pattern of "next most significant", with allowances so that glyph sequences are unique.
  * The sequence of additional roots will determine the fine-grained location of the glyph.


### wan mute (roots)

My goal is to have the "roots" be roughly from simple-to-complex, and to use the established _sitelen sitelen_ phoneme glyphs as a starting point.

The five vowel "infixes" are prominent in many of the full glyphs, so I've chosen to use them as the very beginning. The order is roughly: mouth; basic eye; complex eye/s; full face.

The nine consonant "bases" are next, in this rough order: dots; wrinkles; bumps; different structures.

The above fourteen phoneme glyphs don't quite cover all the existing full glyphs, so I've identified some more shapes (drawing from existing _sitelen pona_ glyphs) as common roots. These are ordered from simple/geometric to complex/anatomical.

Last but not least, two "meta" roots, notable for how they're placed in relation to other self-contained glyphs: the "cartouche" container shape; and the "plinth" supportive-base shape.

**The specific roots and order are still subject to change.**
