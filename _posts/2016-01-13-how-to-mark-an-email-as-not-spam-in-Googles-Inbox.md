title: how to mark an email as "not-spam" in Google's Inbox
tags: [google inbox, ui fail]

I'm using Google's Inbox mail client for work email. Recently I noticed that an email in a thread was marked as being spam, and couldn't find a way to tell Inbox that this automated email wasn't actually spam.

Turns out that pinning and then unpinning an email thread seems to convince Inbox that the contents of the thread aren't to be considered spam.
