title: Setting up SvelteKit to use SQLite and prerender a static site to be hosted on GitLab Pages
tags: [howto, javascript, code]
updated: 2024-07-30
---

I started with `npm init vite` and picked a [SvelteKit] project (using [TypeScript]).

First change-up you've gotta make is to use [the `@sveltejs/adapter-static` adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-static). For Svelte(Kit?) reasons it needs to be one of the `devDependencies`:

```shell
$ npm install -D @sveltejs/adapter-static
```

â€¦then [use it in the `svelte.config.js`](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/932ef981b7e689ea5e70057390b0e1ed6e42e1af/svelte.config.js) to set `strict: false` and specify the `public` directory as the source for `pages` and `assets`:

```js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static'
import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte'
export default {
  preprocess: [vitePreprocess()],
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter({
      pages: 'public',
      assets: 'public',
      fallback: undefined,
      precompress: false,
      strict: false, // https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-static#options-strict
    }),
  },
}
```

[Here's](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/932ef981b7e689ea5e70057390b0e1ed6e42e1af/.gitlab-ci.yml) how I initially got the static site prerendering on GitLab pipeline...

```yml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

image: node:latest
pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run build # even though this appears to create things in `.svelte-kit/output/{client,server}/*`, @sveltejs/adapter-static puts things into the `public/` dir...
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  publish: public # this might be the default
  only:
  - main
```

Okay so at this point GitLab is building the static site and hosting it on GitLab Pages; now for adding SQLite...

First install `better-sqlite3` as one of the `devDependencies` (and if you're using TypeScript, `@types/better-sqlite3` too)...

```shell
$ npm install -D better-sqlite3 @types/better-sqlite3
```

Then pick [a `+page.svelte` file](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/9f8ab5b21fe9329b63892a7e4d0458c3e2a33c8c/src/routes/show/%5Bslug%5D/+page.svelte) which you want to get some data from the database, and open (or create) [its corresponding `+page.server.ts` file](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/9f8ab5b21fe9329b63892a7e4d0458c3e2a33c8c/src/routes/show/%5Bslug%5D/+page.server.ts).
In this file you're gonna import `better-sqlite3`, use it to read the `.db` SQLite file, and run a query to extract some data...

```ts
import {error} from '@sveltejs/kit'
import type {ReqestHandler} from './$types'
import Database from 'better-sqlite3'
import fs from 'node:fs'

const db = new Database(fs.readFileSync('src/path-to-sqlite-data.db'))

export const load: RequestHandler = ({ params }) => {
  const showNum = Number(params.slug)
  const stmt = db.prepare('select * from shows where id like ? limit 1')
  const result = stmt.all(`%${showNum}%`)
  if (result?.length) {
    const [showData] = result
    return showData
  }

  error(404, 'Not found')
}
```

Now [the `+page.svelte`](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/9f8ab5b21fe9329b63892a7e4d0458c3e2a33c8c/src/routes/show/%5Bslug%5D/+page.svelte) will be passed that `showData` object as the `PageLoad` `data`!

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import type { PageLoad } from './$types'
  export let data: PageLoad
</script>

<h1 class="show__title">
  Show #{data.id}: {data.tagline}
</h1>

{#if data.notes}
  <p class="show__notes">{data.notes}</p>
{/if}
```

**Ta-daa! It works! ðŸ™Œ ðŸ¥‚**


## Testing with [Playwright]

I have lots of experience with [Cypress](https://cypress.io), so to try something (else) new I decided to check out [Playwright].

To add Playwright to my existing app, I used the [`create-playwright`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-playwright) CLI tool: `pnpm dlx create-playwright`

It scaffolds a test subdirectory, a (GitHub) CI actions `yaml` file, and installs browsers to test with (chromium, firefox, webkit). Once it's done, it recommends running `pnpm exec playwright test` to set up some starter tests, and then `pnpm exec playwright show-report` to start a local webserver showing the results of the test.

[The Playwright site has suggestions on setup for GitLab CI](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#gitlab-ci), namely to use their `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.45.1-jammy` Docker image:

```yml
tests:
  stage: test
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.45.1-jammy
  script:
      # ...
```

I [added that to my existing `gitlab-ci.yml` file](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/c42658d22d0cf642eae148712005f7899955c1c4/.gitlab-ci.yml) and the default example tests are passing on GitLab CI! (Note that I used the `stages` section to specify that the `test` stage runs first, and if it succeeds then the `deploy` stage runs. I'll work on a `build` stage after I write some tests...)

To start testing my app, I've gotta tell Playwright what URL to visit to find the app. In [Playwright >=1.13.x](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68212980/303896), the `playwright.config.ts` file has a `use` section wherein we can specify the `baseURL` to use what `npm run dev` defaults to:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  use: {
    /* Base URL to use in actions like `await page.goto('/')`. */
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:5173',
  },
  // ...
})
```

To get this working on GitLab, traditionally I'd look for a way to override the `baseURL` in the CI environment... However the bottom of `playwright.config.ts` has a `webServer` section which lets us specify a command for starting the server plus the URL to look for it â€” and we can use the `$CI` environment variable to modify this behavior for running on CI vs local/dev:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  webServer: {
    command: process.env.CI
      ? 'npm run build && npm run preview -- --port 5173 --strictPort'
      : 'npm run dev -- --port 5173 --strictPort',
    url: 'http://localhost:5173',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
  // ...
})
```

...and with that, on GitLab it will `build` and then `preview` the built files, wait for the `url` to be responsive, but on local/dev it will hit the `url` and only run the `command` if there is not something running there!



## Svelte gotchas

Once I got more of my site built, I found that linking from a `+page.svelte` template with slug A to the same template with slug B would result in the URL being changed, but some of the content on the page is not changing... I initially assumed this was due to me breaking Svelte's reactivity in some way, but it turns out to be a common SvelteKit footgun:

* [bug #1075: Navigating between same slug does not change page content](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/1075)
* [bug #1497: Component variables aren't re-initiated when navigating to a different slug](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/1497)
* [discussion: Resetting components on navigation](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/5007)

...so it's _both_ "a feature not a bug" and _also_ due to me not declaring the template's input as "this needs to be reactive". Great.

The Svelte 4 solution is something like this:

```typescript
  export let data: PageLoad
  $: tracksData = data.tracksData
  $: setlistData = tracksData.reduce(/*...*/)
```

...but I'm trying to stick with [Svelte 5](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/introducing-svelte-5/), which means doing the same thing with `$props()` and `$derived()` instead:

```typescript
  let {data} = $props<PageLoad>()
  let setlistData = $derived(data.tracksData.reduce(/* ... */)
```

Note that because this data is coming from the `+page.server.ts` file's `load` function, it ends up at `$props().data` and not within the top-level props.


## Redirects with SvelteKit static adapter

I'm slightly tweaking the URLs for things in this rebuild, so I want to add some redirects from the old formats to the new ones. I've followed [this guide](https://supun.io/sveltekit-static-redirects) to support redirects with the SvelteKit static adapter, but had to tweak it slightly (perhaps for Svelte v5??)... but it's still worth reading because it explains more fully what is going on here:

1. set up a mapping of old-URLs-to-new-URLs in a JS object, and save as `src/redirects.js` (can't use TypeScript for this apparently?)

2. modify/create `src/routes/+layout.server.ts` (note: this belongs in `+layout.server.ts` and not `+layout.ts` as the above blog post says! otherwise you'll break <abbr title="hot module reloading">HMR</abbr> in dev) to import that new `redirects.js` object along with the `redirect` function from SvelteKit, and export a function which checks whether the incoming URL matches one of the keys in the redirect object:

        import {redirect} from '@sveltejs/kit'
        import {REDIRECTS} from '../redirects'
        export async function load({url}) {
          const pathname = url.pathname
          if (REDIRECTS.hasOwnProperty(pathname))
            return redirect(301, REDIRECTS[pathname])
        }

3. Tie the two together by modifying `svelte.config.js` to import the `redirects.js` object and add its keys to the list of routes to prerender:

        export default {
          // ...
          kit: {
            // ...
            prerender: {
              entries: ['*', ...Object.keys(REDIRECTS)],
            },
          },
        }


## Client-side search using Flexsearch

[Flexsearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) makes a lot of [claims about how fast it is on the client-side](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch/blob/961c3ae84a87fb/README.md#performance-benchmark-ranking). That sounds pretty nice, so let's integrate it!

I used [this guide on integrating Flexsearch with SvelteKit](https://joyofcode.xyz/blazing-fast-sveltekit-search) which (despite being aimed at Svelte v4) was quite helpful in pointing the way. The guide mentions adding search match markers to the search response, but I skipped that to start with. Here's what I ended up doing...

* create files:
  * [`src/lib/search.ts`](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/558709644/src/lib/search.ts) â€” contains logic for building and searching the index
  * [`src/routes/search.json/+server.ts`](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/558709644/src/routes/search.json/+server.ts) â€” server-side (in dev; what about when building for static site?) endpoint to "serve prerendered content as JSON"
* pick/create a [`+page.svelte`](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/558709644/src/routes/+page.svelte) where the UX for the search will be (I'm using my home page, i.e. `src/routes/+page.svelte`)
  * use `$state( /*...*/ )` to wrap [the initial values of `searchTerm`, `results`, and the ready flag](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/558709644/src/routes/+page.svelte#L25-27)
  * use `onMount(() => { /*...*/ })` to [retrieve `search.json` and set up the index](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/558709644/src/routes/+page.svelte#L35-39)
  * use `$effect(() => { /*...*/ })` to [wrap the call to `searchSongsIndex(searchTerm)`](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/558709644/src/routes/+page.svelte#L41-45)
  * then your component can [check the ready flag and render the search UX](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/blob/558709644/src/routes/+page.svelte#L62-85)

...and it works!


## Debugging a deploy...

At one point I was happily hacking away and running the site locally with `npm run dev`, but when I pushed up to GitLab the Pipeline failed with this:

```text
$ npm ci
npm warn deprecated rimraf@2.7.1: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm error Exit handler never called!
npm error This is an error with npm itself. Please report this error at:
npm error   <https://github.com/npm/cli/issues>
npm error A complete log of this run can be found in: /root/.npm/_logs/2024-07-18T22_10_54_897Z-debug-0.log
$ npm run build
> almost-dead-dot-net@0.0.1 build
> vite build
sh: 1: vite: not found
```

Ruh roh. First I [enabled debug logging with the `CI_DEBUG_TRACE` variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#enable-debug-logging), but that seems to be like the shell `setopt -o VERBOSE` and was not helpful with the actual error...

Instead, change up [the CI script](https://gitlab.com/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/-/commit/177565417a893d86f47158adb0051a8c3a774e0a#587d266bb27a4dc3022bbed44dfa19849df3044c) to `npm install --cache=.npm` so that error logs will be saved in the current working directory, and then have GitLab capture them as artifacts:

```yml
pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install --cache=.npm && npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
    - .npm/_logs/*
    when: always
  publish: public
  only:
  - main
```

Then even if the job fails, any `npm` logs will be made available as artifacts and can be downloaded and inspected.

In my case, there was no new info about _why_ the Exit handler is never called...

Noticing that I specified the `node:latest` image to build, I tried setting it to use the version of Node I'm using locally: `node:20.9.0`. This changed the error message shown in the Pipeline, giving me a proper stack trace! ðŸŽ‰

```text
npm ERR! code 1
npm ERR! path /builds/alxndr/almost-dead-dot-net/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit
npm ERR! command failed
npm ERR! command sh -c node postinstall.js
npm ERR! Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu. npm has a bug related to optional dependencies (https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828). Please try `npm i` again after removing both package-lock.json and node_modules directory.
```

Dutifully I locally removed the `package-lock.json` and `node_modules/` and reinstalled and committed, and happily GitLab CI was able to build the app!


## TypeScript checking in Vim/NeoVim

Yep I'm one of those weirdos who doesn't use VSCode.

Instead I am a big fan of [NeoVim](https://neovim.io), and lately I've been using [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) to manage language linters/checkers/etc. Helpfully there is a [`svelte-language-server`](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools)! (make sure you're using the one from the official SvelteJS project and not the now-deprecated initial project by James Birtles)

I'd noticed that TypeScript checking was working as expected in `.ts` files, however it's not working in `.svelte` files even with `<script type="ts">`...

Luckily there is [a Discord community for Svelte](https://discord.com/invite/svelte) where folks are pretty quick to respond to questions, and [@TGlide](https://github.com/TGlide) pointed me in the right direction. I needed to configure the TypeScript LSP client to look for `.svelte` files (of course ðŸ¤¦) and also [tweak the Svelte LSP client with something about watched files](https://github.com/alxndr/dotfiles/commit/26b2cc837bd761784#diff-333f3b6c66b09fce0cfdf9d83baa5a9ba2b5725a69a1db1c24d132aaf52b7bf7R340-R345):

```lua
local lsp_capabilities = vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()
lsp_capabilities.workspace.didChangeWatchedFiles = false
lspc.svelte.setup {
  capabilities = lsp_capabilities
}
```

Now NeoVim shows me TypeScript errors/warnings within `.svelte` files, and updates when I edit (not just on save)!


## Acknowledgements

[`npm init vite`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite) does a lot of the backend-for-frontend setup, without which I'd be totally unable to do any of this. Chapeau, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)!

[The SvelteKit docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load) are quite nice, helpful for a brand-new-beginner like me. Thanks Svelters!

[Kisaragi Hiu's blog](https://kisaragi-hiu.com/kemdict-sveltekit-sqlite) shepherded me gently through all of the SQLite stuff! Thank you!
