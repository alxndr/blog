## kipisi nanpa 37

道常無爲而無不爲。侯王若能守之、萬物將自化。化而欲作、吾將鎭之以無名之樸。無名之樸、夫亦將無欲。不欲以靜、天下將自定。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | The Way is always “not-doing”
|  |  | Yet there is nothing it doesn't do.
|  |  | If the rulers are were able to embody it
|  |  | Everyone will naturally be changed.
|  |  | Being changed, they desire to do things.
|  |  | So I must restrain them, using the nameless “uncarved block.”
|  |  | Using the nameless uncarved block
|  |  | They become desireless.
|  |  | Desireless, they are tranquil and
|  |  | All-under-Heaven is naturally settled.
