## kipisi nanpa 26

重爲輕根、靜爲躁君。是以聖人、終日行不離輜重。雖有榮觀、燕處超然。奈何萬乘之主、而以身輕天下、輕則失本、躁則失君。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Heaviness is the root of lightness.
|  |  | Composure is the ruler of instability.
|  |  | Therefore the sage travels all day
|  |  | Without putting down his heavy load.
|  |  | Though there may be spectacles to see
|  |  | He easily passes them by.
|  |  | This being so
|  |  | How could the ruler of a large state
|  |  | Be so concerned with himself as to ignore the people?
|  |  | If you take them lightly you will lose your roots.
|  |  | If you are unstable, you will lose your rulership.
