| 重为轻根             |  | Heaviness is the root of lightness.
| 静为躁君             |  | Composure is the ruler of instability.
| 是以圣人<wbr/>终日行 |  | Therefore the sage travels all day
| 不离辎重             |  | Without putting down his heavy load.
| 虽有荣观             |  | Though there may be spectacles to see
| 燕处超然             |  | He easily passes them by.
| 奈何                 |  | This being so
| 万乘之主             |  | How could the ruler of a large state
| 而以身轻天下         |  | Be so concerned with himself as to ignore the people?
| 轻则失本             |  | If you take them lightly you will lose your roots.
| 躁则失君             |  | If you are unstable, you will lose your rulership.
