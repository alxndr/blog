重为轻根、静为躁君。是以圣人、终日行不离輜重。虽有荣观、燕处超然。奈何万乘之主、而以身轻天下、轻则失本、躁则失君。

|  |  | Heaviness is the root of lightness.
|  |  | Composure is the ruler of instability.
|  |  | Therefore the sage travels all day
|  |  | Without putting down his heavy load.
|  |  | Though there may be spectacles to see
|  |  | He easily passes them by.
|  |  | This being so
|  |  | How could the ruler of a large state
|  |  | Be so concerned with himself as to ignore the people?
|  |  | If you take them lightly you will lose your roots.
|  |  | If you are unstable, you will lose your rulership.
