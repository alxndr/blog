大国者下流。天下之交。天下之牝。牝常以静胜牡。以静为下。故大国以下小国、则取小国。小国以下大国、则取大国。故或下以取、或下而取。大国不过欲兼畜 人、小国不过欲入事人。夫两者各得其所欲。大者宜为下。

|  |  | The great state should be like a river basin.
|  |  | The mixing place of the world,
|  |  | The feminine of the world.
|  |  | The feminine always overcomes the masculine by softness
|  |  | Because softness is lesser.
|  |  | Therefore if a large state serves a small state
|  |  | It will gain the small state.
|  |  | If a small state serves a large state
|  |  | It will gain the large state.
|  |  | Therefore some serve in order to gain
|  |  | And some gain despite their servitude.
|  |  | The large state wants nothing more
|  |  | Than to unite and feed its people.
|  |  | The small state wants nothing more
|  |  | Than to enter into the service of the right person.
|  |  | Thus both get what they want.
|  |  | Greatness lies in placing oneself below.
