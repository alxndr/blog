## kipisi nanpa 76

人之生也柔弱、其死也堅強。草木之生也柔脆、其死也枯稿。故堅強者死之徒、柔弱者生之徒。是以兵強則滅、木強則折。強大處下、柔弱處上。

|  |  | When people are born they are gentle and soft.
|  |  | At death they are hard and stiff.
|  |  | When plants are alive they are soft and delicate.
|  |  | When they die, they wither and dry up.
|  |  | Therefore the hard and stiff are followers of death.
|  |  | The gentle and soft are the followers of life.
|  |  | Thus, if you are aggressive and stiff, you won't win.
|  |  | When a tree is hard enough, it is cut. Therefore
|  |  | The hard and big are lesser,
|  |  | The gentle and soft are greater.
