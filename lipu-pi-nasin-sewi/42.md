## kipisi nanpa 42

道生一、一生二、二生三、三生萬物。萬物負陰而抱陽、沖氣以爲和。人之所惡、唯孤寡不穀、而王公以爲稱。故物或損之而益、或益之而損。人之所教、我亦教 之。強梁者不得其死。吾將以爲教父。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | The Way produces one, one produces two.
|  |  | The two produce the three and the three produce all things.
|  |  | All things submit to yin and embrace yang.
|  |  | They soften their energy to achieve harmony.
|  |  | People hate to think of themselves as “orphan,”“lowly,” and “unworthy”
|  |  | Yet the kings call themselves by these names.
|  |  | Some lose and yet gain,
|  |  | Others gain and yet lose.
|  |  | That which is taught by the people
|  |  | I also teach:
|  |  | “The forceful do not choose their place of death.”
|  |  | I regard this as the father of all teachings.
