道生一、一生二、二生三、三生万物。万物负阴而抱阳、冲气以为和。人之所恶、唯孤寡不穀、而王公以为称。故物或损之而益、或益之而损。人之所教、我亦教 之。强梁者不得其死。吾將以为教父。

|  |  | The Way produces one, one produces two.
|  |  | The two produce the three and the three produce all things.
|  |  | All things submit to yin and embrace yang.
|  |  | They soften their energy to achieve harmony.
|  |  | People hate to think of themselves as “orphan,”“lowly,” and “unworthy”
|  |  | Yet the kings call themselves by these names.
|  |  | Some lose and yet gain,
|  |  | Others gain and yet lose.
|  |  | That which is taught by the people
|  |  | I also teach:
|  |  | “The forceful do not choose their place of death.”
|  |  | I regard this as the father of all teachings.
