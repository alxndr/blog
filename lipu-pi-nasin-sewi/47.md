## kipisi nanpa 47

不出戶、知天下。不闚牖、見天道。其出彌遠、其知彌少。是以聖人不行而知、不見而名、不爲而成。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Without going out the door, knowing everything,
|  |  | Without peeking out the window shades, seeing the Way of Heaven.
|  |  | The further you go, the less you know.
|  |  | Hence the sage
|  |  | Understands without having to go through the whole process.
|  |  | Discerns [^3] without looking.
|  |  | Is perfected without striving.

[^3]: The commentarial tradition reads 名 as meaning 明.
