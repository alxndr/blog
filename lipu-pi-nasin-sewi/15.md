## kipisi nanpa 15

古之善爲士者、微妙玄通、深不可識。夫唯不可識、故強爲之容。豫兮若冬渉川。猶兮若畏四鄰。儼兮其若客。渙兮若冰之將釋。敦兮其若樸。曠兮其若谷。混兮其若濁。孰能濁以靜之徐淸。孰能安以動之徐生。保此道者、不欲盈。夫唯不盈、故能蔽不新成。

|  |  | The ancient masters of the Way
|  |  | Had subtle marvelous mystic penetration
|  |  | A depth that cannot be known.
|  |  | It is exactly because that they are unknowable
|  |  | That we are forced to pay attention to their appearance.
|  |  | Hesitant, like one crossing an ice-covered river.
|  |  | Ready, like one afraid of his neighbors on all sides.
|  |  | Dignified, like a guest.
|  |  | Loose, like ice about to melt.
|  |  | Straightforward, like an uncarved block of wood.
|  |  | Open, like a valley.
|  |  | Obscure, like muddy water.
|  |  | Who can be muddled, and use clarity to gradually become lucid?
|  |  | Who can be calm, and use constant application for eventual success?
|  |  | The one who holds to this path does not crave fulfillment.
|  |  | Precisely because he does not crave fulfillment
|  |  | He can be shattered
|  |  | And do without quick restitution.
