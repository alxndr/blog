## kipisi nanpa 45

大成若缺、其用不弊。大盈若沖、其用不窮。大直若屈、大巧若拙、大辯若訥。躁勝寒、靜勝熱。淸靜爲天下正。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Great perfection seems flawed, yet functions without a hitch.
|  |  | Great fullness seems empty, yet functions without exhaustion.
|  |  | Great straightness seems crooked,
|  |  | Great skill seems clumsy,
|  |  | Great eloquence seems stammering.
|  |  | Excitement overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat.
|  |  | Clarity and stillness set everything right.
