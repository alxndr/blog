## kipisi nanpa 52

天下有始、以爲天下母。旣得其母、以知其子、旣知其子、復守其母、没身不殆。塞其兌、閉其門、終身不勤。開其兌、濟其事、終身不救。見小曰明、守柔日強。 用其光、復歸其明、無遺身殃。是爲習常。

|  |  | All things have a beginning, which we can regard as their Mother.
|  |  | Knowing the mother, we can know its children.
|  |  | Knowing the children, yet still cleaving to the mother
|  |  | You can die without pain.
|  |  | Stop up the holes
|  |  | Shut the doors,
|  |  | You can finish your life without anxiety.
|  |  | Open the doors,
|  |  | Increase your involvements,
|  |  | In the end you can't be helped.
|  |  | Seeing the subtle is called illumination.
|  |  | Keeping flexible is called strength.
|  |  | Use the illumination, but return to the light.
|  |  | Don't bring harm to yourself.
|  |  | This is called “practicing the eternal.”
