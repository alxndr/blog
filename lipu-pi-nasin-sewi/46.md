## kipisi nanpa 46

天下有道、御走馬以糞。天下無道、戎馬生於郊。禍莫大於不知足、咎莫大於欲得。故知足之足 常足矣。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | When the Way prevails in the land
|  |  | Fine horses leisurely graze and fertilize the ground.
|  |  | When the Way is lacking in the land
|  |  | War horses are bred outside the city.
|  |  | There is no greater disaster as bad as not knowing what is enough.
|  |  | No greater than not wanting more.
|  |  | Therefore the sufficiency that comes from knowing what is enough is an eternal sufficiency.
