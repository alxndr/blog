其安易持、其未兆易谋、其脆易 泮 、其微易散。为之於未有、治之於未乱。合抱之木、生於毫末。九层之臺、起於累土。千里之行、始於足下。为者败之、执者失之。是以圣人、无为、故无败。无执、故无失。民之从事、常於几成而败之。愼终如 始、则无败事。是以圣人欲不欲、不贵难得之货。学不学、復众人之所过。以辅万物之自然、而不敢为。

|  |  | That which is at rest is easy to grasp.
|  |  | That which has not yet come about is easy to plan for.
|  |  | That which is fragile is easily broken.
|  |  | That which is minute is easily scattered.
|  |  | Handle things before they arise.
|  |  | Manage affairs before they are in a mess.
|  |  | A thick tree grows from a tiny seed.
|  |  | A tall building arises from a mound of earth.
|  |  | A journey of a thousand miles starts with one step.
|  |  | Contriving, you are defeated;
|  |  | Grasping, you lose.
|  |  | The sage doesn't contrive, so she isn't beaten.
|  |  | Not grasping, she doesn't lose.
|  |  | When people are carrying out their projects
|  |  | They usually blow it at the end.
|  |  | If you are as careful at the end
|  |  | As you were at the beginning,
|  |  | You won't be disappointed.
|  |  | Therefore the sage desires non-desire,
|  |  | Does not value rare goods,
|  |  | Studies the unlearnable
|  |  | So that she can correct the mistakes of average people
|  |  | And aid all things in manifesting their true nature
|  |  | Without presuming to take the initiative.
