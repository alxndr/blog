持而盈之、不如其已。揣而梲之、不可長保。 金玉滿堂、莫之能守。 富貴而驕、自遺其咎。 功遂身退、天之道。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | To hold until full is not as good as stopping.
|  |  | An oversharpened sword cannot last long.
|  |  | A room filled with gold and jewels cannot be protected.
|  |  | Boasting of wealth and virtue brings your demise.
|  |  | After finishing the work, withdraw.
|  |  | This is the Way of Heaven.
