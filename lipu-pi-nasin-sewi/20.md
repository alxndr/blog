绝学无忧。唯之与阿、相去几何。善之与恶、相去若何。人之所畏、不可不畏。荒兮其未央哉。众人煕煕、如享太牢、如春登臺。我独泊兮其未兆、如婴儿之未孩。 儽儽兮若无所归。众人皆有余。而我独若遗。我愚人之心也哉。沌沌兮。俗人昭昭。我独昏昏。俗人察察。我独闷闷。澹兮其若海、 飂 兮若无止。众人皆有以。而我独顽似部。我独异於 人、而贵食母。

|  |  | Get rid of “learning” and there will be no anxiety.
|  |  | How much difference is there between “yes”and “no”?
|  |  | How far removed from each other are “good” and “evil”?
|  |  | Yet what the people are in awe of cannot be disregarded.
|  |  | I am scattered, never having been in a comfortable center.
|  |  | All the people enjoy themselves, as if they are at the festival of the great sacrifice,
|  |  | Or climbing the Spring Platform.
|  |  | I alone remain, not yet having shown myself.
|  |  | Like an infant who has not yet laughed.
|  |  | Weary, like one despairing of no home to return to.
|  |  | All the people enjoy extra
|  |  | While I have left everything behind.
|  |  | I am ignorant of the minds of others.
|  |  | So dull!
|  |  | While average people are clear and bright, I alone am dull and dim.
|  |  | Average people know everything.
|  |  | To me alone all seems covered.
|  |  | So flat!
|  |  | Like the ocean.
|  |  | Blowing around!
|  |  | It seems there is no place to rest.
|  |  | Everybody has a goal in mind.
|  |  | I alone am as ignorant as a bumpkin.
|  |  | I alone differ from people.
|  |  | I enjoy being nourished by the mother.
