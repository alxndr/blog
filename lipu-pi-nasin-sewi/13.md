## kipisi nanpa 13

寵辱若驚。貴大患若身。何謂寵辱若驚。寵爲上、辱爲下。得之若驚、失之若驚。是謂寵辱若驚。何謂貴大患若身。吾所以有大患者、爲吾有身。及吾無身、吾有何 患。故貴以身爲天下、乃可寄天下。愛以身爲天下、乃可託天下。

|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Accept humiliation as a surprise.
|  |  | Value great misfortune as your own self.
|  |  | What do I mean by “Accept humiliation as a surprise”?
|  |  | When you are humble
|  |  | Attainment is a surprise
|  |  | And so is loss.
|  |  | That's why I say, “Accept humiliation as a surprise.”
|  |  | What do I mean by “Value great misfortune as your own self”?
|  |  | If I have no self, how could I experience misfortune?
|  |  | Therefore, if you dedicate your life for the benefit of the world,
|  |  | You can rely on the world.
|  |  | If you love dedicating yourself in this way,
|  |  | You can be entrusted with the world.
