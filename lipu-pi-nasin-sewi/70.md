吾言甚易知、甚易行。天下莫能知、莫能行。言有宗、事有君。夫唯无知、是以不我知。知我者希、则我者贵。是以圣人、被褐怀玉。

|  |  | My words are easy to understand
|  |  | And easy to practice.
|  |  | Yet nobody understands them or practices them.
|  |  | My words have an origin;
|  |  | My actions have a principle.
|  |  | It is only because of your not understanding this
|  |  | That you do not understand me.
|  |  | Since there are few who understand me
|  |  | I am valued.
|  |  | Therefore the sage wears coarse clothes.
|  |  | Yet hides a jewel in his bosom.
