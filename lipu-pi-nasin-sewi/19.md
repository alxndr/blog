## kipisi nanpa 19

絕聖棄智、民利百倍。絕仁棄義、民復孝慈。絕巧棄利、盜賊無有。此三者、以爲文不足。故令有所屬。見素抱樸、少私寡欲。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Get rid of “holiness”and abandon “wisdom”and the people will benefit a hundredfold.
|  |  | Get rid of “humaneness”and abandon “rightness”and the people will return to filial piety and compassion.
|  |  | Get rid of cleverness and abandon profit, and thieves and gangsters will not exist.
|  |  | Since the above three are merely words, they are not sufficient.
|  |  | Therefore there must be something to include them all.
|  |  | See the origin and keep the non-differentiated state.
|  |  | Lessen selfishness and decrease desire.
