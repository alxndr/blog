希言自然。故飘风不终朝、骤雨不终日。孰为此者。天地。天地尚不能久、而况於人乎。故从事於道者。道者同於道、德者同於德、失者同於失。同於道者、道亦乐 得之。同於德者、德亦乐得之。同於失者、失亦乐得之。信不足焉、有不信焉。

|  |  | To speak little is natural.
|  |  | Therefore a gale does not blow a whole morning
|  |  | Nor does a downpour last a whole day.
|  |  | Who does these things? Heaven and Earth.
|  |  | If even Heaven and Earth cannot force perfect continuity
|  |  | How can people expect to?
|  |  | Therefore there is such a thing as aligning one's actions with the Way.
|  |  | If you accord with the Way you become one with it.
|  |  | If you accord with virtue you become one with it.
|  |  | If you accord with loss you become one with it.
|  |  | The Way accepts this accordance gladly.
|  |  | Virtue accepts this accordance gladly.
|  |  | Loss also accepts accordance gladly.
|  |  | If you are untrustworthy, people will not trust you.
