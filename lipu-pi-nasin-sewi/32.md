## kipisi nanpa 32

道常無名 樸雖小、天下莫能臣也。侯王若能守之、萬物將自賓。天地相合、以降甘露。民莫之令而自均。始制有名。名亦旣有、夫亦將知止。知止所以不殆。譬道之在天下、猶川谷 之於江海。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | The Way is always nameless.
|  |  | And even though a sapling might be small
|  |  | No one can make it be his subject.
|  |  | If rulers could embody this principle
|  |  | The myriad things would follow on their own.
|  |  | Heaven and Earth would be in perfect accord
|  |  | And rain sweet dew.
|  |  | Without being ordered, the people naturally govern themselves.
|  |  | And so you have the beginning of division into names.
|  |  | Once there is a name sort something,
|  |  | Then you should stop.
|  |  | Knowing where to stop, you can avoid trouble.
|  |  | The Way's existence in the world
|  |  | Is like valley streams running into the rivers and seas.
