## kipisi nanpa 49

聖人無常心。以百姓心爲心。善者吾善之、不善者吾亦善之。德善。信者吾信之、不信者吾亦信之。德信。聖人在天下、歙歙爲天下渾其心。百姓皆注其耳目。聖人 皆孩之。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | The sage has no fixed mind,
|  |  | She takes the mind of the people as her mind.
|  |  | I treat the good as good, I also treat the evil as good.
|  |  | This is true goodness.
|  |  | I trust the trustworthy, I also trust the untrustworthy.
|  |  | This is real trust.
|  |  | When the sage lives with people, she harmonizes with them
|  |  | And conceals her mind for them.
|  |  | The sages treat them as their little children.
