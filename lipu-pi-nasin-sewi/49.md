| 圣人无常心     |  | The sage has no fixed mind,
| 以百姓心为心   |  | She takes the mind of the people as her mind.
| 善者吾善之<wbr/>不善者吾亦善之   |  | I treat the good as good, I also treat the evil as good.
| 德善           |  | This is true goodness.
| 信者吾信之<wbr/>不信者吾亦信之   |  | I trust the trustworthy, I also trust the untrustworthy.
| 德信           |  | This is real trust.
| 圣人在天下<wbr/>歙歙为天下浑其心 |  | When the sage lives with people, she harmonizes with them
| 百姓皆注其耳目 |  | And conceals her mind for them.
| 圣人皆孩之     |  | The sages treat them as their little children.
