圣人无常心。以百姓心为心。善者吾善之、不善者吾亦善之。德善。信者吾信之、不信者吾亦信之。德信。圣人在天下、歙歙为天下浑其心。百姓皆注其耳目。圣人 皆孩之。

|  |  | The sage has no fixed mind,
|  |  | She takes the mind of the people as her mind.
|  |  | I treat the good as good, I also treat the evil as good.
|  |  | This is true goodness.
|  |  | I trust the trustworthy, I also trust the untrustworthy.
|  |  | This is real trust.
|  |  | When the sage lives with people, she harmonizes with them
|  |  | And conceals her mind for them.
|  |  | The sages treat them as their little children.
