有物混成、先天地生。寂兮寥兮。独立不改、周行而不殆。可以为天下母。吾不知其名。字之曰道。强为之名曰大。大曰逝。逝曰远。远曰反。故道大。天大。地 大。人亦大。域中有四大、而人居其一焉。人法地 地法天 天法道 道法自然。

|  |  | There is something that is perfect in its disorder
|  |  | Which is born before Heaven and Earth.
|  |  | So silent and desolate! It establishes itself without renewal.
|  |  | Functions universally without lapse.
|  |  | We can regard it as the Mother of Everything.
|  |  | I don't know its name.
|  |  | Hence, when forced to name it, I call it “Way.”
|  |  | When forced to categorize it, I call it “great.”
|  |  | Greatness entails transcendence.
|  |  | Transcendence entails going-far.
|  |  | Going-far entails return.
|  |  | Hence, the Way is great, Heaven is great, the Earth is great
|  |  | And the human is also great.
|  |  | Within our realm there are four greatnesses and the human being is one of them.
|  |  | Human beings follow the Earth.
|  |  | Earth follows Heaven
|  |  | Heaven follows the Way
|  |  | The Way follows things as they are.
