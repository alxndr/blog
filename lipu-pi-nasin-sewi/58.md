## kipisi nanpa 58

其政悶悶、其民淳淳。其政察察、其民缺缺。禍兮福之所倚、福兮禍之所伏。孰知其極。其無正。正復爲奇、善復爲妖。人之迷、其日固久。是以聖人方而不割、廉 而不 劌 、直而不肆、光而不耀。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | When the government is laid back
|  |  | The people are relaxed.
|  |  | When the government is nitpicking
|  |  | The people have anxiety.
|  |  | Misfortune depends upon fortune.
|  |  | Fortune conceals misfortune.
|  |  | What has a definite delimitation?
|  |  | Or abnormality?
|  |  | The normal reverts to strangeness.
|  |  | Goodness reverts to perversion.
|  |  | People certainly have been confused for a long time.
|  |  | Therefore the sage squares things without cutting.
|  |  | Edges without separating.
|  |  | Straightens without lining up.
|  |  | Shines but does not glare.
