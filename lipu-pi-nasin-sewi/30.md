以道佐人主者、不以兵强天下。其事好还。师之所处、荆棘生焉。大军之后、必有凶年。善者果而已。不敢以取强。果而勿矜、果而勿伐、果而勿骄。果而不得已、 果而勿强。物壮则老、是谓不道。不道早已。

|  |  | If you used the Way as a principle for ruling
|  |  | You would not dominate the people by military force.
|  |  | What goes around comes around.
|  |  | Where the general has camped
|  |  | Thorns and brambles grow.
|  |  | In the wake of a great army
|  |  | Come years of famine.
|  |  | If you know what you are doing
|  |  | You will do what is necessary and stop there, not daring to use force.
|  |  | Accomplish but don't boast
|  |  | Accomplish without show
|  |  | Accomplish without arrogance
|  |  | Accomplish without grabbing
|  |  | Accomplish without forcing.
|  |  | When things flourish they decline.
|  |  | This is called non-Way
|  |  | The non-Way is short-lived.
