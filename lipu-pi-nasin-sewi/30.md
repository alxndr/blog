## kipisi nanpa 30

以道佐人主者、不以兵強天下。其事好還。師之所處、荊棘生焉。大軍之後、必有凶年。善者果而已。不敢以取強。果而勿矜、果而勿伐、果而勿驕。果而不得已、 果而勿強。物壯則老、是謂不道。不道早已。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | If you used the Way as a principle for ruling
|  |  | You would not dominate the people by military force.
|  |  | What goes around comes around.
|  |  | Where the general has camped
|  |  | Thorns and brambles grow.
|  |  | In the wake of a great army
|  |  | Come years of famine.
|  |  | If you know what you are doing
|  |  | You will do what is necessary and stop there, not daring to use force.
|  |  | Accomplish but don't boast
|  |  | Accomplish without show
|  |  | Accomplish without arrogance
|  |  | Accomplish without grabbing
|  |  | Accomplish without forcing.
|  |  | When things flourish they decline.
|  |  | This is called non-Way
|  |  | The non-Way is short-lived.
