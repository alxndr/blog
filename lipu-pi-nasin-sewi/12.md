## kipisi nanpa 12

五色令人目盲。五音令人耳聾。五味令人口爽。馳騁畋獵、令人心發狂。難得之貨、令人行妨。是以聖人、爲腹不爲目。故去彼取此。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | The five colors blind our eyes.
|  |  | The five tones deafen our ears.
|  |  | The five flavors confuse our taste.
|  |  | Racing and hunting madden our minds.
|  |  | Possessing rare treasures brings about harmful behavior.
|  |  | Therefore the sage acts from his gut, and not from his eyes.
|  |  | He lets go of that and chooses this.
