## kipisi nanpa 31

夫佳兵者不祥之器、物或惡之。故有道者不處。君子居則貴左、用兵則貴右。兵者不祥之器、非君子之器。不得已而用之、恬淡爲上。勝而不美。而美之者、是樂殺 人。夫樂殺人者、則不可以得志於天下矣。吉事尚左、凶事尚右。偏將軍居左、上將軍居右。言以喪禮處之。殺人之衆、以哀悲泣之、戰勝以喪禮處之。

|  |  | Sharp weapons are inauspicious instruments.
|  |  | Everyone hates them.
|  |  | Therefore the man of the Way is not comfortable with them.
|  |  | In the domestic affairs of the gentleman
|  |  | The left is the position of honor.
|  |  | In military affairs the right is the position of honor.
|  |  | Since weapons are inauspicious instruments, they are not the instruments of the gentleman
|  |  | So he uses them without enjoyment
|  |  | And values plainness.
|  |  | Victory is never sweet.
|  |  | Those for whom victory is sweet
|  |  | Are those who enjoy killing.
|  |  | If you enjoy killing, you cannot gain the trust of the people.
|  |  | On auspicious occasions the place of honor is on the left.
|  |  | On inauspicious occasions the place of honor is on the right.
|  |  | The lieutenant commander stands on the left.
|  |  | The commander-in-chief stands on the right.
|  |  | And they speak, using the funerary rites to bury them.
|  |  | The common people, from whom all the dead have come
|  |  | Weep in lamentation.
|  |  | The victors bury them with funerary rites.
