上善若水。水善利萬物而不爭、處衆人之所惡。故幾於道。居善地、心善淵、與善仁、言善信、正善治、事善能、動善時。夫唯不爭、故無尤。

|  |  | The highest goodness is like water.
|  |  | Water easily benefits all things without struggle.
|  |  | Yet it abides in places that men hate.
|  |  | Therefore it is like the Way.
|  |  | For dwelling, the Earth is good.
|  |  | For the mind, depth is good.
|  |  | The goodness of giving is in the timing.
|  |  | The goodness of speech is in honesty.
|  |  | In government, self-mastery is good.
|  |  | In handling affairs, ability is good.
|  |  | If you do not wrangle, you will not be blamed.
