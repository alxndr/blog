善行无辙迹、善言无瑕謫、善数无用筹策。善闭无关 楗 、而不可开。善结无绳约、而不可解。是以圣人、 常善救人。故无弃人。常善救物。故无弃物。是谓袭明。故善人者、不善人之师、不善人者、善人之资、不贵其师、不爱其资。虽智大迷。是谓要妙。

|  |  | A good traveler leaves no tracks.
|  |  | Good speech lacks faultfinding.
|  |  | A good counter needs no calculator.
|  |  | A well-shut door will stay closed without a latch.
|  |  | Skillful fastening will stay tied without knots.
|  |  | It is in this manner that the sage is always skillful in elevating people.
|  |  | Therefore she does not discard anybody.
|  |  | She is always skillful in helping things
|  |  | Therefore she does not discard anything.
|  |  | This is called “the actualization of her luminosity.”
|  |  | Hence, the good are the teachers of the not-so-good.
|  |  | And the not-so-good are the charges of the good.
|  |  | Not valuing your teacher or not loving your students:
|  |  | Even if you are smart, you are gravely in error.
|  |  | This is called Essential Subtlety.
