## kipisi nanpa 21

孔德之容、惟道是從。道之爲物、惟恍惟惚。惚兮恍兮、其中有象。恍兮惚兮、其中有物。窮兮冥兮、其中有精。其精甚眞、其中有信。自古及今、其名不去、以閱 衆甫。吾何以知衆甫之狀哉。以此。

|  |  | The form of great virtue is something that only the Way can follow.

|  |  | How vague! How obscure! In it are things.
|  |  | How deep! How dark! In it there is an essence.
|  |  | The essence is so real—therein is belief.
|  |  | From the present to antiquity, its name has never left it, so we can examine all origins.
|  |  | How do I know the form of all origins?
