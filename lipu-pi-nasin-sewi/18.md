## kipisi nanpa 18

大道廢、有仁義。慧智出、有大僞。六親不和、有孝慈。國家昏亂、有忠臣。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | When the great Way perishes
|  |  | There is humaneness and justice.
|  |  | When intelligence is manifest
|  |  | There is great deception.
|  |  | When the six relationships are not in harmony
|  |  | There is filial piety and compassion.
|  |  | When the country is in chaos
|  |  | Loyal ministers appear.
