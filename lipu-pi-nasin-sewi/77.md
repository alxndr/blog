## kipisi nanpa 77

天之道其猶張弓與。高者抑之、下者擧之。有餘者損之 不足者補之。天之道損有餘而補不足。人之道則不然、損不足以奉有餘。孰能有餘以奉天下。唯有道者。是以聖人、爲而不侍、功成而不處、其不欲見賢。

|  |  | The Way of Heaven
|  |  | Is like stretching a bow.
|  |  | The top is pulled down,
|  |  | The bottom is pulled up.
|  |  | Excess string is removed
|  |  | Where more is needed, it is added.
|  |  | It is the Way of Heaven
|  |  | To remove where there is excess
|  |  | And add where there is lack.
|  |  | The way of people is different:
|  |  | They take away where there is need
|  |  | And add where there is surplus.
|  |  | Who can take his surplus and give it to the people?
|  |  | Only one who possesses the Way.
|  |  | Therefore the sage acts without expectation.
|  |  | Does not abide in his accomplishments.
|  |  | Does not want to show his virtue.
