|-:|:-:|:-
|  | 不尚賢使民不爭         | If you do not adulate the worthy, you will make others non-contentious.
|  | 不貴難得之貨使民不爲盜 | If you do not value rare treasures, you will stop others from stealing.
|  | 不見可欲使民心不亂     | If people do not see desirables, they will not be agitated.
|  | 是以聖人之治           | Therefore, when the sage governs,
|  | 虛其心                 | He clears people's minds,
|  | 實其腹                 | Fills their bellies,
|  | 弱其志                 | Weakens their ambition, (and)
|  | 強其骨                 | Strengthens their bones.
|  | 常使民無知無欲         | If the people are kept without cleverness and desire,
|  | 使夫知者不敢爲也       | It will make the intellectuals not dare to meddle.
|  | 爲無爲則無不治         | Acting without contrivance, there is no lack of manageability.
