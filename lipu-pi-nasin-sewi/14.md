## kipisi nanpa 14

視之不見、名日夷。聽之不間、名日希。縛之不得、名曰微。此三者不可致詰。故混而爲一。其上不皦、其下不昧。繩繩不可名、復歸於無物。是謂無狀之狀、無物 之象。是謂惚恍。迎之不見其首、隨之不見其後。執古之道、以御今之有。能知古始、是謂道紀。

|  |  | Look for it, it cannot be seen.
|  |  | It is called the distant.
|  |  | Listen for it, it cannot be heard.
|  |  | It is called the rare.
|  |  | Reach for it, it cannot be gotten.
|  |  | It is called the subtle.
|  |  | These three ultimately cannot be fathomed.
|  |  | Therefore they join to become one.
|  |  | Its top is not bright;
|  |  | Its bottom is not dark;
|  |  | Existing continuously, it cannot be named and it returns to no-thingness.
|  |  | Thus, it is called the formless form,
|  |  | The image of no-thing.
|  |  | This is called the most obscure.
|  |  | Go to meet it, you cannot see its face.
|  |  | Follow it, you cannot see its back.
|  |  | By holding to the ancient Way
|  |  | You can manage present existence
|  |  | And know the primordial beginning.
|  |  | This is called the very beginning thread of the Way.
