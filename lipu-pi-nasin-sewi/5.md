天地不仁、以萬物爲芻狗。聖人不仁、以百姓爲芻狗。天地之間、其猶豪衞乎。虛而不屈、動而愈出。多言數窮。不如守中。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Heaven and Earth are not humane,
|  |  | And regard the myriad things as straw dogs.
|  |  | The sage is not humane,
|  |  | And regards all the people as straw dogs.
|  |  | The space between Heaven and Earth is just like a bellows:
|  |  | Empty it, it is not exhausted.
|  |  | Squeeze it and more comes out.
|  |  | Excessive verbiage is usually a dead end
|  |  | Is not as good as holding to the center.
