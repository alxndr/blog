## kipisi nanpa 51

道生之、德畜之、物形之、勢成之。是以萬物、莫不尊道而貴德。道之尊、德之貴、夫莫之命而常自然。故道生之、德畜之、長之、育之、亭之、毒之、蓋之、覆 之。生而不有、爲而不恃、長而不宰。是謂玄德

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Way gives birth to it,
|  |  | Virtue rears it,
|  |  | Materiality shapes it,
|  |  | Activity perfects it.
|  |  | Therefore, there are none of the myriad things who do not venerate the Way or esteem its virtue.
|  |  | This veneration of the Way and esteeming of its virtue is something they do naturally, without being forced.
|  |  | Therefore, the Way gives birth.
|  |  | Its virtue rears, develops, raises, adjusts and disciplines,
|  |  | Nourishes, covers and protects,
|  |  | Produces but does not possess,
|  |  | Acts without expectation,
|  |  | Leads without forcing.
|  |  | This is called “Mysterious Virtue.”
