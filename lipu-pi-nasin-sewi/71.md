## kipisi nanpa 71

知不知上、不知知病。夫唯病病、是以不病。聖人不病、以其病病。是以不病

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | There is nothing better than to know that you don't know.
|  |  | Not knowing, yet thinking you know—
|  |  | This is sickness.
|  |  | Only when you are sick of being sick
|  |  | Can you be cured.
|  |  | The sage's not being sick
|  |  | Is because she is sick of sickness.
|  |  | Therefore she is not sick.
