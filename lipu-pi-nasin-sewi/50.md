出生、入死。生之徒十有三、死之徒十有三。人之生、动之死地亦十有三。夫何故。以其生生之厚。盖闻、善摄摄生者、陆行不遇 兕 虎、入军不被甲兵。 兕 无所投其角、虎无所措其爪、兵无所容其刃。夫何 故。以其无死地。

|  |  | Coming into life and entering death,
|  |  | The followers of life are three in ten.
|  |  | The followers of death are three in ten.
|  |  | Those whose life activity is their death ground are three in ten.
|  |  | Why is this?
|  |  | Because they live life grasping for its rich taste.
|  |  | Now I have heard that those who are expert in handling life
|  |  | Can travel the land without meeting tigers and rhinos,
|  |  | Can enter battle without being wounded.
|  |  | The rhino has no place to plant its horn,
|  |  | The tiger has no place to place its claws,
|  |  | Weapons find no place to receive their sharp edges.
|  |  | Why?
|  |  | Because he has no death-ground.
