## kipisi nanpa 36

將欲歙之、必固張之。將欲弱之、必固強之。將欲廢之、必固興之。將欲奪之、必固與之。是謂微明。柔弱勝剛強。魚不可脫於淵。國之利器、不可以示人。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | That which will be shrunk
|  |  | Must first be stretched.
|  |  | That which will be weakened
|  |  | Must first be strengthened.
|  |  | That which will be torn down
|  |  | Must first be raised up.
|  |  | That which will be taken
|  |  | Must first be given.
|  |  | This is called “subtle awareness.”
|  |  | The soft and weak overcomes the hard and strong.
|  |  | A fish should not leave the depths of the waters.
|  |  | The country's potent weapons
|  |  | Should not be shown to its people.
