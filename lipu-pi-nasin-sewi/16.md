| 致虚极 |  | Effect vacuity to the extreme.
| 守静篤 |  | Keep stillness whole.
| 万物並作 |  | Myriad things act in concert.
| 吾以观复 |  | I therefore watch their return.
| 夫物芸芸 |  | All things flourish and each returns to its root.
| 各复归其根 |  | Returning to the root is called quietude.
|  |  | Quietude is called returning to life.
|  |  | Return to life is called constant.
|  |  | Knowing this constant is called illumination.
|  |  | Acting arbitrarily without knowing the constant is harmful.
|  |  | Knowing the constant is receptivity, which is impartial.
|  |  | Impartiality is kingship.
|  |  | Kingship is Heaven.
|  |  | Heaven is the Way
|  |  | the Way is eternal.
|  |  | Though you lose the body, you do not die.
