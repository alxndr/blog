## kipisi nanpa 16

致虛極、守靜篤。萬物竝作、吾以觀復。夫物藝藝、各復歸其根。歸根曰靜。是謂復命。復命曰常。知常曰明。不知常、妄作凶。知常容。容乃公。公乃王。王乃 天。天乃道。道乃久。没身不殆。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Effect vacuity to the extreme.
|  |  | Keep stillness whole.
|  |  | Myriad things act in concert.
|  |  | I therefore watch their return.
|  |  | All things flourish and each returns to its root.
|  |  | Returning to the root is called quietude.
|  |  | Quietude is called returning to life.
|  |  | Return to life is called constant.
|  |  | Knowing this constant is called illumination.
|  |  | Acting arbitrarily without knowing the constant is harmful.
|  |  | Knowing the constant is receptivity, which is impartial.
|  |  | Impartiality is kingship.
|  |  | Kingship is Heaven.
|  |  | Heaven is the Way
|  |  | the Way is eternal.
|  |  | Though you lose the body, you do not die.
