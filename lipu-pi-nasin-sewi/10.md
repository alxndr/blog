載營塊抱一、能無離乎。專氣致柔、能嬰兒乎。濃除玄覽、能無疲乎。愛民治國、能無爲乎。天門開鬪、能爲雌乎。明白四達、能無知乎。生之、畜之。生而不有、 爲而不侍、長而不宰。是謂玄德

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Pacifying the agitated material soul and holding to oneness:
|  |  | Are you able to avoid separation?
|  |  | Focusing your energy on the release of tension:
|  |  | Can you be like an infant?
|  |  | In purifying your insight:
|  |  | Can you un-obstruct it?
|  |  | Loving the people and ruling the state:
|  |  | Can you avoid over-manipulation?
|  |  | In opening and closing the gate of Heaven:
|  |  | Can you be the female?
|  |  | In illuminating the whole universe:
|  |  | Can you be free of rationality?
|  |  | Give birth to it and nourish it.
|  |  | Produce it but don't possess it.
|  |  | Act without expectation.
|  |  | Excel, but don't take charge.
|  |  | This is called Mysterious Virtue.
