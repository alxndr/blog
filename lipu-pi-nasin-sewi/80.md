## kipisi nanpa 80

小國寡民、使有什伯之器而不用。使民重死而不遠徒。雖有舟輿、無所乘之、雖有甲兵、無所陳之。使人復結繩而用之、甘其食、美其服、安其居、樂其俗、鄰國相 望、鷄犬之聲相聞、民至老死不相往來。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Let there be a small country with few people,
|  |  | Who, even having much machinery, don't use it.
|  |  | Who take death seriously and don't wander far away.
|  |  | Even though they have boats and carriages, they never ride in them.
|  |  | Having armor and weapons, they never go to war.
|  |  | Let them return to measurement by tying knots in rope.
|  |  | Sweeten their food, give them nice clothes, a peaceful abode and a relaxed life.
|  |  | Even though the next country can be seen and its dogs and chickens can be heard,
|  |  | The people will grow old and die without visiting each other's land.
