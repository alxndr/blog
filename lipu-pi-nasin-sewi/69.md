## kipisi nanpa 69

用兵有言、吾不敢爲主而爲客、不敢進寸而退尺。是謂行無行、攘無臂、 扔 無敵、執無兵。禍莫大於輕敵。輕敵幾喪吾寶。故 抗兵相如、哀者勝矣。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Strategists have a saying:
|  |  | I prefer to be able to move, rather than be in a fixed position
|  |  | I prefer to retreat a foot rather than advancing an inch.
|  |  | This is called progress without advancing;
|  |  | Preparing without showing off;
|  |  | Smashing where there is no defense;
|  |  | Taking him without a fight.
|  |  | There is no greater danger than under-estimating your opponent.
|  |  | If I under-estimate my opponent
|  |  | I will lose that which is most dear.
|  |  | Therefore
|  |  | When opponents clash
|  |  | The one who is sorry about it will be the winner.
