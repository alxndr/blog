## kipisi nanpa 73

勇於敢則殺、勇於不敢則活。此兩者或利、或害。天之所惡、孰知其故。是以聖人猶難之。天之道不爭而善勝、不言而善應、不召而自來、 繟 然而善謀。天網恢恢、疏而不失。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | If you are courageous in daring you will die.
|  |  | If you are courageous in not-daring you will live.
|  |  | Among these two, one is beneficial and the other is harmful.
|  |  | Who understands the reason why Heaven dislikes what it dislikes?
|  |  | Even the sage has difficulty in knowing this.
|  |  | The Way of Heaven is to win easily without struggle.
|  |  | To respond well without words,
|  |  | To naturally come without special invitation,
|  |  | To plan well without anxiety.
|  |  | Heaven's net is vast.
|  |  | It is loose.
|  |  | Yet nothing slips through.
