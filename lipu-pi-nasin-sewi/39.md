## kipisi nanpa 39

昔之得一者。天得一以淸、地得一以寧、神得一以靈、谷得一以盈、萬物得一以生、侯王得一以爲天下貞。其致之、一也。天無以淸將恐裂。地無以寧將恐發。神無以靈將恐歇。谷無以盈將恐竭。萬物無以生將恐滅。侯王無以貞將恐蹶。故貴以賤爲本、高以下爲基。是以侯王自謂孤寡不穀。此非以賤爲本邪。非乎。故致數輿無輿。不欲琭琭如玉、珞珞如石。

|  |  | These in the past have attained wholeness:
|  |  | Heaven attains wholeness with its clarity;
|  |  | The Earth attains wholeness with its firmness;
|  |  | The Spirit attains wholeness with its transcendence;
|  |  | The Valley attain wholeness when filled;
|  |  | The Myriad Things attain wholeness in life;
|  |  | The Ruler attains wholeness in the correct governance of the people.
|  |  | In effecting this:
|  |  | If Heaven lacked clarity it would be divided;
|  |  | If the Earth lacked firmness it would fly away;
|  |  | If the spirit lacked transcendence it would be exhausted;
|  |  | If the valley lacked fullness it would be depleted;
|  |  | If the myriad things lacked life they would vanish.
|  |  | If the ruler lacks nobility and loftiness he will be tripped up.
|  |  | Hence
|  |  | Nobility has lowliness as its root
|  |  | The High has the Low as its base.
|  |  | Thus the kings call themselves “the orphan, the lowly, the unworthy.”
|  |  | Is this not taking lowliness as the fundamental? Isn't it?
|  |  | In this way you can bring about great effect without burden.
|  |  | Not desiring the rarity of gems
|  |  | Or the manyness of grains of sand.
