| 昔之得一者               |  | These in the past have attained wholeness:
| 天得一以清               |  | Heaven attains wholeness with its clarity;
| 地得一以宁               |  | The Earth attains wholeness with its firmness;
| 神得一以灵               |  | The Spirit attains wholeness with its transcendence;
| 谷得一以盈               |  | The Valley attain wholeness when filled;
| 万物得一以生             |  | The Myriad Things attain wholeness in life;
| 侯王得一以<wbr/>为天下贞 |  | The Ruler attains wholeness in the correct governance of the people.
| 其致之                   |  | In effecting this:
| 天无以清<wbr/>将恐裂     |  | If Heaven lacked clarity it would be divided;
| 地无以宁<wbr/>将恐发     |  | If the Earth lacked firmness it would fly away;
| 神无以灵<wbr/>将恐歇     |  | If the spirit lacked transcendence it would be exhausted;
| 谷无以盈<wbr/>将恐竭     |  | If the valley lacked fullness it would be depleted;
| 万物无以生<wbr/>将恐灭   |  | If the myriad things lacked life they would vanish.
| 侯王无以贵<wbr/>高将恐蹶 |  | If the ruler lacks nobility and loftiness he will be tripped up.
| 故                       |  | Hence
| 贵以贱为本               |  | Nobility has lowliness as its root
| 高以下为基               |  | The High has the Low as its base.
| 是以侯王自称孤<wbr/>寡<wbr/>不谷 |  | Thus the kings call themselves “the orphan, the lowly, the unworthy.”
| 此非以贱为本耶<wbr/>非乎 |  | Is this not taking lowliness as the fundamental? Isn't it?
| 故<wbr/>致数誉无誉       |  | In this way you can bring about great effect without burden.
| 不欲琭琭如玉             |  | Not desiring the rarity of gems
| 珞珞如石                 |  | Or the manyness of grains of sand.
