## kipisi nanpa 28

知其雄、守其雌、爲天下谿。爲天下谿、常德不離、復歸於嬰兒。知其白、守其黑、爲天下式。爲天下式、常德不忒 、復歸於無極。知其榮、守其辱、爲天下谷。爲天下谷、常德乃足、復歸於樸。樸散則爲器。聖人用之、則爲官長。故大制不割。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Know the Masculine, cleave to the Feminine
|  |  | Be a valley for everyone.
|  |  | Being a valley for everyone
|  |  | You are always in virtue without lapse
|  |  | And you return to infancy.
|  |  | Know the White, but cleave to the Black. [^1]
|  |  | Be a model for everyone.
|  |  | Being a model for everyone
|  |  | You are always in virtue and free from error
|  |  | You return to limitlessness.
|  |  | Know Glory but cleave to Humiliation
|  |  | Be the valley for everyone.
|  |  | When your constancy in virtue is complete
|  |  | You return to the state of the “uncarved block.”
|  |  | The block is cut into implements.
|  |  | If the sage uses it, he ends up being an official.
|  |  | Therefore the great tailor does not cut.

[^1]: [Miller:] The “black” is the deep, religious, mystic part of our experience. The “white” is our involvement in mundane affairs. We should well understand how the conventional world operates, but our priority should lie in adhering to deeper principles.
