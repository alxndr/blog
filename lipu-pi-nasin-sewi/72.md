## kipisi nanpa 72

民不畏威、則大威至。無狎其所居、無厭其所生。夫唯不厭、是以不厭。是以聖人、自知不自見、自愛不自貴。故去彼取此。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | When the people do not fear your might
|  |  | Then your might has truly become great.
|  |  | Don't interfere with their household affairs.
|  |  | Don't oppress their livelihood.
|  |  | If you don't oppress them they won't feel oppressed.
|  |  | Thus the sage understands herself
|  |  | But does not show herself.
|  |  | Loves herself
|  |  | But does not prize herself.
|  |  | Therefore she lets go of that
|  |  | And takes this.
