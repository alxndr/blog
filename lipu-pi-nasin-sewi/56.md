知者不言、言者不知。塞其兑 闭其门 挫其锐 解其纷 和其光 同其尘。是谓玄同。故不可得而亲、不可得而疏。不可得而利、不可得而害。不可得而贵、不可得而贱。故为天下贵。

|  |  | Close your holes, shut your doors,
|  |  | Soften your sharpness, loosen your knots.
|  |  | Soften your glare and merge with the everyday.
|  |  | This is called mysteriously attaining oneness.
|  |  | Though you cannot possess it, you are intimate with it
|  |  | And at the same time, distant.
|  |  | Though you cannot possess it, you are benefitted by it,
|  |  | And harmed by it.
|  |  | You cannot possess it, but are esteemed through it
|  |  | And humbled by it.
|  |  | Therefore the world values you.
