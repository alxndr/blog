## kipisi nanpa 56

知者不言、言者不知。塞其兌 閉其門 挫其銳 解其紛 和其光 同其塵。是謂玄同。故不可得而親、不可得而疏。不可得而利、不可得而害。不可得而貴、不可得而賤。故爲天下貴。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | One who knows does not speak.
|  |  | One who speaks does not know.
|  |  | Close your holes, shut your doors,
|  |  | Soften your sharpness, loosen your knots.
|  |  | Soften your glare and merge with the everyday.
|  |  | This is called mysteriously attaining oneness.
|  |  | Though you cannot possess it, you are intimate with it
|  |  | And at the same time, distant.
|  |  | Though you cannot possess it, you are benefitted by it,
|  |  | And harmed by it.
|  |  | You cannot possess it, but are esteemed through it
|  |  | And humbled by it.
|  |  | Therefore the world values you.
