## kipisi nanpa 48

爲學日益、爲道日損。損之又損、以至於無爲。無爲而無不爲。取天下常以無事。及其有事、不足以取天下。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | In studying, each day something is gained.
|  |  | In following the Way, each day something is lost.
|  |  | Lost and again lost.
|  |  | Until there is nothing left to do.
|  |  | Not-doing, nothing is left undone.
|  |  | You can possess the world by never manipulating it.
|  |  | No matter how much you manipulate
|  |  | You can never possess the world.
