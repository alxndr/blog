## kipisi nanpa 55

含德之厚、比於赤子。蜂 蠆虺 蛇不螫、猛獸不據、攫鳥不持。骨弱筋柔而握固。 未知牝牡之合而全作。精之至也。終日號而不嗄。和之至也。知和曰常、知常曰明。益生曰祥、心使氣曰強。物壯則老、謂之不道。不道早已。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | One who remains rich in virtuous power
|  |  | Is like a newborn baby.
|  |  | Bees, scorpions and venomous snakes do not bite it,
|  |  | The wild beasts do not attack it,
|  |  | Birds of prey do not sink their claws into it.
|  |  | Though its bones are weak
|  |  | And muscles soft,
|  |  | Its grip is strong.
|  |  | Without knowing of the blending of male and female
|  |  | S/he is a perfect production,
|  |  | The ultimate in vitality.
|  |  | S/he cries all day without getting hoarse.
|  |  | S/he is the ultimate in harmony.
|  |  | Understanding harmony is called the Constant.
|  |  | Knowing the Constant is called illumination.
|  |  | Nourishing life is called blessing.
|  |  | Having control of your breath is called strength.
|  |  | After things blossom they decay, and
|  |  | This is called the non-Way.
|  |  | The non-Way expires quickly.
