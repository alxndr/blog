天長地久。天地所以能長且久者、以其不自生。故能長生 是以聖人、後其身而身先、外其身而身 非以其無私耶。故能成其私。

|  |  | Heaven and Earth last forever.
|  |  | The reason that Heaven and Earth are able to last forever
|  |  | Is because they do not give birth to themselves.
|  |  | Therefore, they are always alive.
|  |  | Hence, the sage puts herself last and is first.
|  |  | She is outside herself and therefore her self lasts.
|  |  | Is it not through her selflessness
|  |  | That she is able to perfect herself?
