## kipisi nanpa 75

民之饑、以其上食税之多。是以饑。民之難治、以其上之有爲。是以難治。民之輕死、以其上求生之厚。是以輕死。夫唯無以生爲者、是賢於貴生。

|  |  | The reason people starve
|  |  | Is because their rulers tax them excessively.
|  |  | They are difficult to govern
|  |  | Because their rulers have their own ends in mind.
|  |  | The reason people take death lightly
|  |  | Is because they want life to be rich.
|  |  | Therefore they take death lightly.
|  |  | It is only by not living for your own ends
|  |  | That you can go beyond valuing life.
