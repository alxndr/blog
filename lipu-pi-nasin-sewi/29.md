## kipisi nanpa 29

將欲取天下而爲之、吾見其不得已。天下神器。不可爲也。爲者敗之、執者失之。故物或行或隨、或歔或吹、或強或羸、或載或 隳 。是以聖人、去甚、去奢、去泰。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | If you want to grab the world and run it
|  |  | I can see that you will not succeed.
|  |  | The world is a spiritual vessel, which can't be controlled.
|  |  | Manipulators mess things up.
|  |  | Grabbers lose it. Therefore:
|  |  | Sometimes you lead
|  |  | Sometimes you follow
|  |  | Sometimes you are stifled
|  |  | Sometimes you breathe easy
|  |  | Sometimes you are strong
|  |  | Sometimes you are weak
|  |  | Sometimes you destroy
|  |  | And sometimes you are destroyed.
|  |  | Hence, the sage shuns excess
|  |  | Shuns grandiosity
|  |  | Shuns arrogance.
