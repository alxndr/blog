## kipisi nanpa 38

上德不德、是以有德。下德不失德、是以無德。上德無爲而無以爲、下德爲之而有以爲。上仁爲之而無以爲。上義爲之而有以爲。上禮爲之而莫之應、則攘臂而 扔 之。故失道而後、德。失德而後、仁。失仁而後、義。失義而後、禮。夫禮者、忠信之薄、而亂之首。前識者、道之華、而愚之始。是以大丈夫處其厚、不居其薄。處其實、不居其華。 故、去彼、取此。

|  |  | Superior virtue is not virtuous
|  |  | Therefore it has virtue.
|  |  | Inferior virtue never fails to be virtuous
|  |  | Therefore it has no virtue.
|  |  | Superior virtue does not “act”
|  |  | And has no intentions.
|  |  | Inferior virtue “acts”
|  |  | And always has intentions.
|  |  | Superior humaneness“acts”
|  |  | But has no intentions.
|  |  | Superior justice “acts”
|  |  | But but has intentions.
|  |  | Superior propriety “acts”and if you don't respond
|  |  | They will roll up their sleeves and threaten you.
|  |  | Thus, when the Way is lost there is virtue
|  |  | When virtue is lost there is humaneness
|  |  | When humaneness is lost there is justice
|  |  | And when justice is lost there is propriety.
|  |  | Now “propriety”is the external appearance of loyalty and sincerity
|  |  | And the beginning of disorder.
|  |  | Occult abilities are just flowers of the Way
|  |  | And the beginning of foolishness.
|  |  | Therefore the Great Person dwells in the substantial
|  |  | And not in the superficial.
|  |  | Rests in the fruit and not in the flower.
|  |  | So let go of that and grasp this.
