上德不德、是以有德。下德不失德、是以无德。上德无为而无以为、下德为之而有以为。上仁为之而无以为。上义为之而有以为。上礼为之而莫之应、则攘臂而 扔 之。故失道而后、德。失德而后、仁。失仁而后、义。失义而后、礼。夫礼者、忠信之薄、而乱之首。前识者、道之华、而愚之始。是以大丈夫处其厚、不居其薄。处其实、不居其华。 故、去彼、取此。

|  |  | Superior virtue is not virtuous
|  |  | Therefore it has virtue.
|  |  | Inferior virtue never fails to be virtuous
|  |  | Therefore it has no virtue.
|  |  | Superior virtue does not “act”
|  |  | And has no intentions.
|  |  | Inferior virtue “acts”
|  |  | And always has intentions.
|  |  | Superior humaneness“acts”
|  |  | But has no intentions.
|  |  | Superior justice “acts”
|  |  | But but has intentions.
|  |  | Superior propriety “acts”and if you don't respond
|  |  | They will roll up their sleeves and threaten you.
|  |  | Thus, when the Way is lost there is virtue
|  |  | When virtue is lost there is humaneness
|  |  | When humaneness is lost there is justice
|  |  | And when justice is lost there is propriety.
|  |  | Now “propriety”is the external appearance of loyalty and sincerity
|  |  | And the beginning of disorder.
|  |  | Occult abilities are just flowers of the Way
|  |  | And the beginning of foolishness.
|  |  | Therefore the Great Person dwells in the substantial
|  |  | And not in the superficial.
|  |  | Rests in the fruit and not in the flower.
|  |  | So let go of that and grasp this.
