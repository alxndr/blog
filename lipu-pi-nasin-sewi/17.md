## kipisi nanpa 17

太上、下知有之。其次、親而譽之。其次、畏之。其次、侮之。信不足焉、有不信焉。悠兮其貴言。功成事遂、百姓皆謂我自然。

|  |  | From great antiquity forth they have known and possessed it.
|  |  | Those of the next level loved and praised it.
|  |  | The next were in awe of it.
|  |  | And the next despised it.
|  |  | If you lack sincerity no one will believe you.
|  |  | How careful she is with her precious words!
|  |  | When her work is complete and her job is finished,
|  |  | Everybody says: “We did it!”
