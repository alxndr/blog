大道氾兮、其可左右。万物恃之而生 而不辞。功成不名有。衣养万物而不为主。常无欲、可名於小。万物归焉而不为主、可名为大。以其终不自为大、故能成其大。

|  |  | The myriad things are produced relying on it, but it does not distinguish them.
|  |  | It brings them to completion without claiming possession.
|  |  | It clothes and feeds all things without lording over them.
|  |  | Always desireless, it can be called “the small.”
|  |  | The myriad things rely on it and it doesn't true to rule them
|  |  | Thus it can be called “great.”
|  |  | Till the end, it does not regard itself as Great.
|  |  | Therefore it able to be great.
