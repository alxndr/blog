## kipisi nanpa 34

大道氾兮、其可左右。萬物恃之而生 而不辭。功成不名有。衣養萬物而不爲主。常無欲、可名於小。萬物歸焉而不爲主、可名爲大。以其終不自爲大、故能成其大。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | The great Way flows over, spreading in every direction.
|  |  | The myriad things are produced relying on it, but it does not distinguish them.
|  |  | It brings them to completion without claiming possession.
|  |  | It clothes and feeds all things without lording over them.
|  |  | Always desireless, it can be called “the small.”
|  |  | The myriad things rely on it and it doesn't true to rule them
|  |  | Thus it can be called “great.”
|  |  | Till the end, it does not regard itself as Great.
|  |  | Therefore it able to be great.
