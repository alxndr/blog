## kipisi nanpa 24

企者不立。跨者不行。自見者不明。自是者不彰。自伐者無功。\[自矜者不長\]。其在道也、曰餘食贅行。物或惡之。故有道者不處。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Standing on tiptoe, you are unsteady.
|  |  | Straddle-legged, you cannot go.
|  |  | If you show yourself, you will not be seen.
|  |  | If you affirm yourself, you will not shine.
|  |  | If you boast, you will have no merit.
|  |  | If you promote yourself, you will have no success.
|  |  | Those who abide in the Way call these
|  |  | Leftover food and wasted action
|  |  | And all things dislike them.
|  |  | Therefore the person of the Way does not act like this.
