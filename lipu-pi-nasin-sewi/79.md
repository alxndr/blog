和大怨必有余怨。安可以为善。是以圣人执左契而不责於人。有德司契、无德司彻。天道无亲、常与善人。

|  |  | After settling down for great anger
|  |  | There are always resentments left over.
|  |  | How can this be considered as good?
|  |  | Therefore the sage keeps her part of the deal, [^8]
|  |  | And doesn't badger the other party.
|  |  | The virtuous ascertain the content of the contract itself;
|  |  | Those without virtue are concerned about it's being exacted. [^9]
|  |  | The Heavenly Way has no favorites:
|  |  | It always raises up the Good. [^10]

[^8]: 左契 literally means the “left side of the tally.” Ancient contracts in East Asia were made by writing the agreement on a wooden board that would be broken in half, and rematched when the contract had been fulfilled.
[^9]: The interpretation of 司契 and 司徹 here varies considerably among translators. We take it as one of the plethora of expressions of the pervasive notion of wu-wei in the Daodejing, which implies doing things by focusing on the content, and what one can actual do well, rather than on expectations of a rapid conclusion. Cf. the translations by D.C. Lau, Richard Llynn, Ellen Chen, John Wu, and others.
[^10]: Cf. Analects 4:10: The Master said: “When the noble man deals with the world he is not prejudiced for or against anything. He does what is Right.” 子曰。君子之於天下也、無適也、無莫也、義之與比。
