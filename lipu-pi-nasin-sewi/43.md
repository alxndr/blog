## kipisi nanpa 43

天下之至柔、馳騁天下之至堅。無有入無間。吾是以知無爲之有益。不言之教、無爲之益、天下希及之。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | The softest thing in the world
|  |  | Will overcome the hardest.
|  |  | Non-being can enter where there is no space.
|  |  | Therefore I know the benefit of unattached-action.
|  |  | The wordless teaching and unattached-action
|  |  | Are rarely seen.
