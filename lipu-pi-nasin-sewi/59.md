## kipisi nanpa 59

治人事天、莫若嗇。夫唯嗇、是謂早服。早服謂之重積德。重積德、則無不克。無不克、則莫知其極。莫知其極、可以有國。有國之母、可以長久。是謂深根、固柢、長生、久視之道。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | In governing the country and serving Heaven
|  |  | There is nothing like frugality.
|  |  | Only by being frugal can you recover quickly.
|  |  | When you recover quickly you accumulate virtue.
|  |  | Having accumulated virtue,
|  |  | There is nothing you can't overcome.
|  |  | When there is nothing you can't overcome
|  |  | Who knows the limits of your capabilities?
|  |  | These limits being unfathomable
|  |  | You can possess the country.
|  |  | The Mother who possesses the country can be long-living.
|  |  | This is called “planting the roots deeply and firmly.”
|  |  | The way to long life and eternal vision.
