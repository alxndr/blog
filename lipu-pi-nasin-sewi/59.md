治人事天、莫若嗇。夫唯嗇、是谓早服。早服谓之重积德。重积德、则无不克。无不克、则莫知其极。莫知其极、可以有国。有国之母、可以长久。是谓深根、固柢、长生、久视之道。

|  |  | In governing the country and serving Heaven
|  |  | There is nothing like frugality.
|  |  | Only by being frugal can you recover quickly.
|  |  | When you recover quickly you accumulate virtue.
|  |  | Having accumulated virtue,
|  |  | There is nothing you can't overcome.
|  |  | When there is nothing you can't overcome
|  |  | Who knows the limits of your capabilities?
|  |  | These limits being unfathomable
|  |  | You can possess the country.
|  |  | The Mother who possesses the country can be long-living.
|  |  | This is called “planting the roots deeply and firmly.”
|  |  | The way to long life and eternal vision.
