曲则全。枉则直。洼则盈。敝则新。少则得。多则惑。是以圣人抱一、为天下式。不自见、故明。不自是、故彰。不自伐、故有功 不自务、故长。夫唯不争、故天下莫能与之争。古之所谓曲则全者、岂虚言哉。诚全而归之。

|  |  | The imperfect is completed.
|  |  | The crooked is straightened.
|  |  | The empty is filled.
|  |  | The old is renewed.
|  |  | With few there is attainment.
|  |  | With much there is confusion.
|  |  | Therefore the sage grasps the one and becomes the model for all.
|  |  | She does not show herself, and therefore is apparent.
|  |  | She does not affirm herself, and therefore is acknowledged.
|  |  | She does not boast and therefore has merit.
|  |  | She does not strive and is therefore successful.
|  |  | It is exactly because she does not contend, that nobody can contend with her.
|  |  | How could the ancient saying, “The imperfect is completed” be regarded as empty talk?
|  |  | Believe in the complete and return to it.
