## kipisi nanpa 22

曲則全。枉則直。窪則盈。敝則新。少則得。多則惑。是以聖人抱一、爲天下式。不自見、故明。不自是、故彰。不自伐、故有功 不自務、故長。夫唯不爭、故天下莫能與之爭。古之所謂曲則全者、豈虛言哉。誠全而歸之。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | The imperfect is completed.
|  |  | The crooked is straightened.
|  |  | The empty is filled.
|  |  | The old is renewed.
|  |  | With few there is attainment.
|  |  | With much there is confusion.
|  |  | Therefore the sage grasps the one and becomes the model for all.
|  |  | She does not show herself, and therefore is apparent.
|  |  | She does not affirm herself, and therefore is acknowledged.
|  |  | She does not boast and therefore has merit.
|  |  | She does not strive and is therefore successful.
|  |  | It is exactly because she does not contend, that nobody can contend with her.
|  |  | How could the ancient saying, “The imperfect is completed” be regarded as empty talk?
|  |  | Believe in the complete and return to it.
