## kipisi nanpa 44

名與身孰親 身與貨孰多。得與亡孰病。是故甚愛必大費、多藏必厚亡。知足不辱、知止不殆、可以長久。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Which is dearer, fame or your life?
|  |  | Which is greater, your life or possessions?
|  |  | Which is more painful, gain or loss?
|  |  | Therefore we always pay a great price for excessive love
|  |  | And suffer deep loss for great accumulation.
|  |  | Knowing what is enough, you will not be humiliated.
|  |  | Knowing where to stop, you will not be imperiled
|  |  | And can be long-lasting.
