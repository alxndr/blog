## kipisi nanpa 74

民不畏死、奈何以死懼之。若使民常畏死、而爲奇者、吾得執而殺之、執敢。常有司殺者殺。夫代司殺者殺、是謂代大匠 斵 。夫代大匠斷者、希有不傷其手矣。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | If the people don't fear death
|  |  | How will you scare them with death?
|  |  | If you make the people continuously fear death
|  |  | By seizing anybody who does something out of the ordinary
|  |  | And killing them,
|  |  | Who will dare to move?
|  |  | There is always an official executioner to handle this.
|  |  | If you play the role of the official executioner
|  |  | It is like cutting wood in the capacity of Master Carpenter.
|  |  | There are few who will not cut their hands.
