上士闻道、勤而行之。中士闻道、若存若亡。下士闻道、大笑之。不笑不足以为道。故建言有之。明道若昧。进道若退。夷道若 纇 。上德若谷。大白若辱。广德若不足。建德若偸。 质眞若渝 大方无隅。大器晩成。大音希声。大象无形。道隱无名 夫唯道、善贷且成。

|  |  | When superior students hear of the Way
|  |  | They strive to practice it.
|  |  | When middling students hear of the Way
|  |  | They sometimes keep it and sometimes lose it.
|  |  | When inferior students hear of the Way
|  |  | They have a big laugh.
|  |  | But “not laughing”in itself is not sufficient to be called the Way, and therefore it is said:
|  |  | The sparkling Way seems dark
|  |  | Advancing in the Way seems like regression.
|  |  | Settling into the Way seems rough.
|  |  | True virtue is like a valley.
|  |  | The immaculate seems humble.
|  |  | Extensive virtue seems insufficient.
|  |  | Established virtue seems deceptive.
|  |  | The face of reality seems to change.
|  |  | The great square has no corners.
|  |  | Great ability takes a long time to perfect.
|  |  | Great sound is hard to hear.
|  |  | The great form has no shape.
|  |  | The Way is hidden and nameless.
|  |  | This is exactly why the Way is good at developing and perfecting.
