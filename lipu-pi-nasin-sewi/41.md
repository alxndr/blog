；上德若谷；太白若辱；广德若不足；建德若偷；质真若渝；大方无隅；大器晚成；大音希声；大象无形；道隐无名。夫唯道，善贷且成。

| 上士闻道 |  | When superior students hear of the Way
| 勤而行之 |  | They strive to practice it.
| 中士闻道 |  | When middling students hear of the Way
| 若存若亡 |  | They sometimes keep it and sometimes lose it.
| 下士闻道 |  | When inferior students hear of the Way
| 大笑之 |  | They have a big laugh.
| 不笑不足以为道 |  | But “not laughing” in itself is not sufficient to be called the Way, and therefore it is said:
| 故建言有之 |  | The sparkling Way seems dark
| 明道若昧 |  | Advancing in the Way seems like regression.
| 进道若退 |  | Settling into the Way seems rough.
| 夷道若纇 |  | True virtue is like a valley.
|  |  | The immaculate seems humble.
|  |  | Extensive virtue seems insufficient.
|  |  | Established virtue seems deceptive.
|  |  | The face of reality seems to change.
|  |  | The great square has no corners.
|  |  | Great ability takes a long time to perfect.
|  |  | Great sound is hard to hear.
|  |  | The great form has no shape.
|  |  | The Way is hidden and nameless.
|  |  | This is exactly why the Way is good at developing and perfecting.
