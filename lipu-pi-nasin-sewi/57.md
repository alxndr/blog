以正治国、以奇用兵、以无事取天下。吾何以知其然哉。以此。天下多忌讳、而民弥贫。民多利器、国家滋昏。人多伎巧、奇物滋起。法令滋彰、盗贼多有。故圣人 云、我无为而民自化。我好静而民自正。我无事而民自富。我无欲而民自朴。

|  |  | Use fairness in governing the state.
|  |  | Use surprise tactics in war.
|  |  | Be unconcerned and you will have the world.
|  |  | How do I know it is like this?
|  |  | Because:
|  |  | The more regulations there are,
|  |  | The poorer people become.
|  |  | The more people own lethal weapons,
|  |  | The more darkened are the country and clans.
|  |  | The more clever the people are,
|  |  | The more extraordinary actions they take.
|  |  | The more picky the laws are,
|  |  | The more thieves and gangsters there are.
|  |  | Therefore the sages say:
|  |  | I do not force my way and the people transform themselves.
|  |  | I enjoy my serenity and the people correct themselves.
|  |  | I do not interfere and the people enrich themselves.
|  |  | I have no desires
|  |  | And the people find their original mind.
