## kipisi nanpa 57

以正治國、以奇用兵、以無事取天下。吾何以知其然哉。以此。天下多忌諱、而民彌貧。民多利器、國家滋昏。人多伎巧、奇物滋起。法令滋彰、盜賊多有。故聖人 云、我無爲而民自化。我好靜而民自正。我無事而民自富。我無欲而民自樸。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Use fairness in governing the state.
|  |  | Use surprise tactics in war.
|  |  | Be unconcerned and you will have the world.
|  |  | How do I know it is like this?
|  |  | Because:
|  |  | The more regulations there are,
|  |  | The poorer people become.
|  |  | The more people own lethal weapons,
|  |  | The more darkened are the country and clans.
|  |  | The more clever the people are,
|  |  | The more extraordinary actions they take.
|  |  | The more picky the laws are,
|  |  | The more thieves and gangsters there are.
|  |  | Therefore the sages say:
|  |  | I do not force my way and the people transform themselves.
|  |  | I enjoy my serenity and the people correct themselves.
|  |  | I do not interfere and the people enrich themselves.
|  |  | I have no desires
|  |  | And the people find their original mind.
