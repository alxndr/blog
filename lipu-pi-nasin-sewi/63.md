为无为、事无事、味无味。大小多少、报怨以德。图难於其易、为大於其细。天下难事必作於易、天下大事必作於细。是以圣人终不为大、故能成其大。夫轻诺必寡信、多易必多难。是以圣人犹难之。故终无难矣。

|  |  | Do without “doing.”
|  |  | Get involved without manipulating.
|  |  | Taste without tasting.
|  |  | Make the great small,
|  |  | The many, few.
|  |  | Respond to anger with virtue.
|  |  | Deal with difficulties while they are still easy.
|  |  | Handle the great while it is still small.
|  |  | The difficult problems in life
|  |  | Always start off being simple.
|  |  | Great affairs always start off being small.
|  |  | Therefore the sage never deals with the great
|  |  | And is able to actualize his greatness.
|  |  | Now light words generate little belief,
|  |  | Much ease turns into much difficulty.
|  |  | Therefore the sage treats things as though they were difficult,
|  |  | And hence, never has difficulty.
