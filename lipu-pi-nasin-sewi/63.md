## kipisi nanpa 63

爲無爲、事無事、味無味。大小多少、報怨以德。圖難於其易、爲大於其細。天下難事必作於易、天下大事必作於細。是以聖人終不爲大、故能成其大。夫輕諾必寡信、多易必多難。是以聖人猶難之。故終無難矣。

| Toki Pona | Chinese | English
|-:|:-:|:-
|  |  | Do without “doing.”
|  |  | Get involved without manipulating.
|  |  | Taste without tasting.
|  |  | Make the great small,
|  |  | The many, few.
|  |  | Respond to anger with virtue.
|  |  | Deal with difficulties while they are still easy.
|  |  | Handle the great while it is still small.
|  |  | The difficult problems in life
|  |  | Always start off being simple.
|  |  | Great affairs always start off being small.
|  |  | Therefore the sage never deals with the great
|  |  | And is able to actualize his greatness.
|  |  | Now light words generate little belief,
|  |  | Much ease turns into much difficulty.
|  |  | Therefore the sage treats things as though they were difficult,
|  |  | And hence, never has difficulty.
