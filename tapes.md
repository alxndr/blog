[Here is a spreadsheet of everything I've taped](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pn7yvgBpwUkqC-wLwvJay5M9DA0iQbMcDAf1v55ONss/edit?usp=sharing), with links for the ones which I've already processed.  
<span style="font-size:0.8em">Gray background means I haven't processed it yet — if something interests you, please get in touch! Email `alxndr` at the Google mail company, and include "tapes" in the subject so I won't ignore it.</span>

Certain bands / musicians have given permission for tapes to be posted at the Live Music Archive @ Archive.org — [my collection can be found here](https://archive.org/details/@drwxrxrx).
