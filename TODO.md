# TODOs

* [ ] investigate astro v6 upgrade... https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v6/

* testing...
    * [ ] investigate writing a custom lint rule (or Cypress plugin rule) to warn against `cy.reload()` in tests — `cy.reload()` is unreliable for asserting on state that depends on client-side JS hydration (e.g. Svelte `client:load`); the correct pattern is seeding `localStorage` via `onBeforeLoad` in `cy.visit()`
